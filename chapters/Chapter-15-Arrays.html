          data without declaring thousands of scalar variables. In this lesson 
          we explain the terms <u>data structure</u> and <u>algorithm</u>, and 
          then introduce you to a very important data structure, the <u>array</u>. 
          With each new data structure comes the complementary algorithms to manipulate 
          the data it stores. This combination of data structures and algorithms 
          provide the powerful tools needed to solve computer science problems.</p>

        <p>1. A scalar type is a simple data type which holds one value at a time. 
          The data types <b>int, double, char, </b>and<b> boolean</b> are important 
          and useful, but limited.</p>
        <p>2. A data structure is a collection of scalar data types which are 
          all referenced or accessed through one identifier.</p>
        <p>3. Data structures can be created to store information about any real-world 
          situation:<br>
          a. Your high school transcript is a collection of grades.<br>
          b. The English paper you wrote on a word processor is stored as a collection 
          of characters, punctuation, and formatting codes.<br>
          c. Your name, address, and phone number can be stored as a collection 
          of strings.</p>
        <p>4. After defining a data structure, algorithms will be needed to solve 
          the specific problems associated with such a data structure.</p>
        <p>5. One example of a data structure is an array. An array will store 
          a list of values.</p>
        <p>6. An algorithm is a sequence of programmed steps which solves a specific 
          problem.</p>
        <p>7. The fundamental algorithms which apply to an array data structure 
          are: insertion, deletion, traversal, searching, and sorting. <br>
        </p>
        <p><font size=+2><u>B. Example of an Array</u></font></p>
        <p>1. The following program will introduce you to some of the syntax and 
          usage of the <i>array</i> class in Java:</p>
        <p><u>Program 17-1</u><br>
        
        <pre>&nbsp;<b>public class</b> ArrayExample
{
  <b>public static void</b> main (String[] args)
  {
    <b>int</b>[] A = <b>new</b> int[6];  //  an array of 6 integers
    <b>int</b> loop;

    <b>for</b> (loop = 0; loop < 6; loop++)
      A[loop] = loop * loop;
    System.out.println("The contents of array A are:");
    System.out.println();
    <b>for</b> (loop = 0; loop < 6; loop++)
      System.out.print("  " + A[loop]);
    System.out.println();
  }
}

Run output:

The contents of array A are:

  0  1  4  9  16  25
</pre>
        <p> 2. An array is a linear data structure composed of adjacent memory 
          locations each holding values of the same type.<br>
        </p>
        <pre>
<img src="fig1.jpg" width="292" height="115"></pre>
        <p>3. The variable A is an array, a group of 6 related scalar values. 
          There are six locations in this array referenced by index positions 
          0 to 5. It might seem odd to begin a list at position 0 instead of position 
          1. </p>
        <p>4. The variable &quot;loop&quot; is used in a for loop to reference 
          index positions 0 through 5. The square of each index position is stored 
          in the memory location occupied by each cell of the array. The syntax 
          for accessing a memory location of an array requires the use of square 
          brackets [].</p>
        <p>5. The square brackets [] are collectively an operator in Java. They 
          are similar to the parentheses as they have the highest level of precedence 
          compared to all other operators.<br>
        </p>
        <p><font size=+2><u>C. Array Declarations and Memory Allocation</u></font></p>
        <p>1.Array declarations look like this: </p>
        <p><code><b>type</b>[] arrayName;</code></p>
        <p>This tells the compiler that arrayName will be used as the name of 
          an array containing type. However, the actual array is not constructed 
          by this declaration. Often an array is declared and constructed in one 
          statetment like this:<br>
          <br>
          <code><b>type</b>[] arrayName = <b>new</b> type[length];</code></p>
        <p>This tells the compiler that arrayName will be used as the name of 
          an array containing <b>type</b>, and constructs an array object containing 
          length number of slots.</p>
        <p>2. An array is an object, and like any other object in Java is constructed 
          out of main storage as the program is running. The array constructor 
          uses different syntax than most object constructors; <b>type</b>[length] 
          names the type of data in each slot and the number of slots. For example:<br>
        </p>
        <pre><b>int</b>[] list = <b>new</b> int[6];
<b>double</b>[] data = <b>new</b> double[1000];
<b>char</b>[] line = <b>new</b> char[80];</pre>
        <p>Once an array has been constructed, the number of slots it has does 
          not change.</p>
        <p>3. The size of an array can be defined by using a final value.<br>
        </p>
        <pre><b>final int</b> MAX = 200;
<b>int</b>[] numb = <b>new int</b>[MAX];
</pre>
        <p>4. When an array is declared, enough memory is allocated to set up 
          the full size of the array. For example, the array of int as described 
          above, <code><b>int</b>[] list = <b>new</b> int[6]</code>, will require 
          24 bytes of memory (4 bytes per cell).<br>
          <br>
          <font size=+2><u>D. Application of Arrays</u></font></p>
        <p>1. Suppose we have a text file of integer data (<i>votes.txt</i>) which 
          contains all the votes cast in an election. This election happened to 
          have three candidates and the values in the integer file range from 
          1-3.<br>
        </p>
        <p><u>Program 17-2</u></p>
        <pre><b>import </b>apcslib.*;

<b>public class</b> Votes
{
  <b>public static void</b> main (String[] args)
  {
    TextReader inFile = <b>new</b> TextReader(fileName);
      
    <b>int</b> vote, total = 0, loop;
   
    // sized to 4 boxes, initialized to 0's
   <b> int</b>[] data = <b>new</b> int[4];

    vote = inFile.readlnInt();
    while (!inFile.eof())
    {
      data[vote]++;
      total++;
      vote = inFile.readlnInt();
    }
    System.out.println("Total # of votes = " + total);
    <b>for</b> (loop = 1; loop <= 3; loop++)
      System.out.println("Votes for #" + loop +
                         " = " + data[loop]);

  }
}
</pre>
        <p>a. The array data consists of four cells, each holding an integer amount. 
          The first cell, data[0], is allocated but not used in this problem. 
          We could have stored the information for candidate 1 in position 0, 
          candidate 2 in position 1, and so forth, but the code is easier to follow 
          if we can use a direct correspondence.</p>
        <p><img src="fig2.jpg" width="292" height="116"></p>
        <p>b. The value of vote is used to increment the appropriate cell of the 
          array by +1.</p>
        <p>2. A second example counts the occurrence of each alphabet letter in 
          a text file.</p>
        <p><u>Program 17-3</u></p>
        <pre><b>import</b> apcslib.*;

<b>public class </b>CountLetters
{
  <b>public static void</b> main (String[] args)
  {
    TextReader inFile = <b>new</b> TextReader("sample.txt");
   
   // use positions 1..26 to count letters
   <b>int</b>[] letters = <b>new int</b>[27];
   <b>char</b> c1;
   <b>int</b> loop, total = 0;

   c1 = inFile.readChar();
   while (!inFile.eof())
   {
      <b>if</b> ('A' <= c1 && c1 <= 'Z')  // if c1 is upper case
         c1 = (char)(c1 + 32);     // change c1 to lower case
      <b>if </b>('a' <= c1 && c1 <= 'z')  // if we have a letter...
      {
         letters[c1 - 96]++;  // if c1 == 'a', 97-96 = 1, etc.
         total++;
      }
      c1 = inFile.readChar();
   }
   System.out.println("Count letters");
   System.out.println();
   c1 = 'a';
   <b>for</b> (loop = 1; loop <= 26; loop++)
   {
      System.out.println(c1 + " : " + letters[loop]);
      c1++;
   }
   System.out.println();
   System.out.println("Total letters = " + total);
  }
}</pre>
        <p>a. Each character in the text file is read into c1. If c1 is an uppercase 
          letter it is converted to its lowercase counterpart.<br>
          b. If the character is a letter, the ASCII value of the letter is adjusted 
          to fit the range from 1-26. For example, if c1 == 'a', the program solves 
          97 - 96 = 1. Then the appropriate cell of the array is incremented by 
          one.<br>
          c. Again, position 0 in the array is not used to make the data processing 
          easier.</p>
        <p><font size=+2><u>E. Passing Arrays as Parameters</u></font></p>
        <p>1. The program in Handout, H.A.17.2, will provide examples of passing 
          arrays as parameters. Notice that a global integer constant of 6 is 
          used to size the array in this program. </p>
        <p>2. The main method declares an array named data. The array is initialized 
          with the values 0..5 inside main method.</p>
        <p>3. The parameters of the squareList and printList methods are references 
          to an array object. Any local reference to array list inside function 
          squareList or printList is an alias for the array data inside of the 
          main method. Notice that after the call of squareList, the values stored 
          in array data in function main method have been permanently changed.</p>
        <p>4. When rotateList method is called, the copy method of the ArrayOps 
          class is invoked and the local array listCopy is created as a copy of 
          the array data in main method. </p>
        <p>5. The rotateList method rotates the values one cell to the right, 
          with the last value moved to the front of the list. A call to printList 
          is made inside the rotateList method just before leaving the method. 
          After returning to main method, notice that the array data is unchanged. 
          <br>
        </p>
        <p><font size=+2><u>F. Arrays and Algorithms</u></font></p>
        <p>1. Insertion is a standard problem that must be solved for all data 
          structures. Suppose an array had 10 values and an 11th value was to 
          be added. We are assuming the array can store at least 11 values.</p>
        <p>a. If we could place the new value at the end, there would be no problem.<br>
          b. But if the new value must be inserted at the beginning of the list 
          in position 0, the other 10 values must be moved one cell down the list.</p>
        <p>2. Deletion of a value creates an empty cell that probably must be 
          dealt with. The most likely solution after deleting a value, is to move 
          all values which are to the right of the empty spot one cell to the 
          left.</p>
        <p>3. A traversal of an array consists of visiting every cell location, 
          probably in order. The visit could involve printing out the array, initializing 
          the array, finding the largest or smallest value in the array, etc.</p>
        <p>4. Sorting an array means to organize values in either ascending or 
          descending order. These algorithms will be covered in depth in future 
          lessons.</p>
        <p>5. Searching an array means to find a specific value in the array. 
          There are several standard algorithms for searching an array. These 
          will be covered in future lessons.</p>
