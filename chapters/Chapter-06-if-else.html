      <p><font size=+2>A. <u>Structured Programming</u></font></p>
      <p>1. Up to this point in your study of computer science and Java, you have 
        created programs that used only sequential execution. So far most programs 
        have consisted of a sequence of lines that are executed once, line-by-line. 
        As we add the power of loops and selection, we need to use these tools 
        in a disciplined manner. </p>
      <p>2. In the early days of programming (1960's), the approach to writing 
        software was relatively primitive and ineffective. Much of the code was 
        written with <b>goto</b> statements that transferred program control to 
        another part of the code. Tracing this type of code was an exercise in 
        jumping from one spot to another, leaving behind a trail of lines similar 
        to spaghetti. The term &quot;spaghetti code&quot; comes from trying to 
        trace code linked together with <b>goto</b> statements.</p>
      <p>3. The research of Bohm and Jacopini has led to the rules of structured 
        programming. Here are five tenets of structured programming.</p>
      <p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;No goto statements are to be used in writing code.<br>
        b. &nbsp;&nbsp;All programs can be written in terms of three control structures: 
        sequence, selection, and iteration.<br>
        c.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each control structure has one entrance point and one exit 
        point. We will sometimes allow for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multiple 
        exit points from a control structure using the break statement.<br>
        d. &nbsp;&nbsp;Control structures may be stacked (sequenced) one after 
        the other.<br>
        e. &nbsp;&nbsp;Control structures may be nested inside other control structures.<br>
      </p>
      <p>4. The control structures of Java encourage structured programming. Staying 
        within the guidelines of structured programming has led to great productivity 
        gains in the field of software engineering.</p>
      <p><font size=+2>B. &nbsp;<u>Control Structures</u></font></p>
      <p>1. There are only three necessary control structures needed to write 
        programs: sequence, selection, and iteration. 
      <p> 
      <p></p>
      <p>2. Sequence refers to the line-by-line execution as used in your programs 
        so far. The program enters the sequence, does each step, and exits the 
        sequence.
      <p></p>
      <p>3. Selection is the control structure that allows choice among different 
        directions. Java provides different degrees of selection:
      <p>oOne-way selection with an if structure<br>
        o Two-way selection with an if-else structure<br>
        o Multiple selection with a switch structure<br>
        <br>
      <p></p>
      <p>4. Iteration refers to looping. Java provides three loop structures:
      <p> o <b>while</b> loops<br>
        o <b>do-while</b> loops<br>
        o <b>for</b> loops<br>
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>5. Of the seven control structures, the <b>if-else</b> and <b>while</b> 
        loop are the most flexible and powerful for problem-solving. The other 
        control structures have their place, but <b>if-else</b> and <b>while</b> 
        are the most common control structures used in Java code.
      <p>6. The diagrams in H.A.8.2, <i>Control Structures in Java</i>, are flowcharts 
        that describe the flow of program control. A statement rectangle in any 
        control structure can be a simple line or even another control structure. 
        A statement can also be a compound statement which consists of multiple 
        statements.</p>
      <p><font size=+2>C. &nbsp;<u>Algorithm Development and Pseudocode</u></font></p>
      <p>1. An algorithm is a solution to a problem. Computer scientists are in 
        the problem-solving business. They use techniques of structured programming 
        to develop solutions to problems. Algorithms will range from the easier 
        &quot;finding the average of two numbers&quot; to the more difficult &quot;visiting 
        all the subdirectories on a hard disk, searching for a file.&quot;</p>
      <p>2. A major task of the implementation stage is the conversion of rough 
        designs into refined algorithms that can then be coded in the implementation 
        language of choice.</p>
      <p>3. Pseudocode refers to a rough-draft outline of an answer, written in 
        English-like terms. We will probably use phrases and words that are close 
        to programming languages, but avoid using any specific language. Once 
        the pseudocode has been developed, translation into code occurs more easily 
        than if we had skipped this pseudocode stage.</p>
      <p>4. Stepwise refinement is the process of gradually developing a more 
        detailed description of an algorithm. Problem solving in computer science 
        involves overall development of the sections of a program, expanding each 
        section with more detail, later working out the individual steps of an 
        algorithm using pseudocode, then finally writing a code solution.</p>
      <p>5. The handout, H.A.8.3, <i>Pseudocode and Algorithm Development</i>, 
        will present a thorough example of this process. You should read this 
        now.
      <p><font size=+2>D. &nbsp;<u>Relational Operators</u></font></p>
      <p> 1. A relational operator is a binary operator that compares two values. 
        The following symbols are used in Java as relational operators: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> &lt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;less than<br>
          &gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;greater than<br>
          &lt;= &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;less than or equal to<br>
          &gt;=&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;greater than or equal to<br>
          == &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;equal to<br>
          != &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not equal to<br>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>2. A relational operator is used to compare two values, resulting in 
        a relational expression. For example:</p>
      <pre>number &gt; 16 'F' == grade passing &gt;= 60</pre>
      <p>3. The result of a relational expression is a <b>boolean</b> value, <b>true</b> 
        or <b>false</b>.</p>
      <p>4. When character data is compared, the ASCII code values are used to 
        determine the answer. The following expressions result in the answers 
        given:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> 'A' &lt; 'B' evaluates as true, (65 &lt; 66)<br>
          'd' &lt; 'a' evaluates as false, (100 &lt; 97)<br>
          't' &lt; 'X' evaluates as false, (116 &lt; 88)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p> In the last example, you must remember that upper case letters come 
        first in the ASCII collating sequence; the lower case letters follow after 
        and consequently have larger ASCII values than do upper case ('A' = 65, 
        'a' = 97).<br>
      </p>
      <p><font size=+2>E. &nbsp;<u>Logical Operators</u></font></p>
      <p>1. The three logical operators of programming are AND, OR, and NOT. These 
        operators are represented by the following symbols in Java:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> AND &amp;&amp;<br>
          OR || (two vertical bars)<br>
          NOT !<br>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>2. The <u>and</u> operator requires both operands (values) to be true 
        for the result to be true.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> T and T = true<br>
          T and F = false<br>
          F and T = false<br>
          F and F = false</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>3. The following are Java examples of using the &amp;&amp; (and) operator.
      <pre> ( (2 &lt; 3) &amp;&amp; (3.5 &gt; 3.0) ) evaluates as true
 ( (1 == 0) &amp;&amp; (2 != 3) ) evaluates as false</pre>
      <p> The &amp;&amp; operator performs short-circuit evaluation in Java. If 
        the first half of an &amp;&amp; statement is false, the operator immediately 
        returns false without evaluating the second half.<br>
      </p>
      <p>4. The or operator requires only one operand (value) to be true for the 
        result to be true.</p>
      <p> T or T = true<br>
        T or F = true<br>
        F or T = true<br>
        F or F = false<br>
      </p>
      <p>5. The following is a Java example of using the || (or) operator.</p>
      <p> ( (2+3 &lt; 10) || (21 &gt; 19) ) evaluates as true</p>
      <p> The || operator also performs short-circuit evaluation in Java. If the 
        first half of an || statement is true, the operator immediately returns 
        true without evaluating the second half.<br>
      </p>
      6. The ! operator is a unary operator that changes a boolean value to its 
      opposite. 
      <blockquote>
        <p> ! false = true<br>
          ! true = false</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size=+2><a name="precedence"></a>F. &nbsp;<u>Precedence and Associativity of Operators</u></font></p>
      <p>1. Introducing two new sets of operators (relational and logical) adds 
        to the complexity of operator precedence in Java. An abbreviated precedence 
        chart is included here. The complete precedence chart was given in Handout 
        H.A.4.2, <i>Operator Precedence in Java</i>.</p>
      <p>Table 8-1 Precedence and Associativity of Operators<br>
      </p>

                = += -= *= /= </p>
            </div>
          </td>
          <td> 
            <div align="center">right to left<br>

              left to right<br>
              left to right<br>
              left to right<br>
              right to left </div>

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>2. Because the logical operators have low precedence in Java, parentheses 
        are not needed to maintain the correct order of solving problems. However, 
        they can be used to make complex expressions more readable.
      <p> ((2 + 3 &lt; 10) &amp;&amp; (75 % 12 != 12)) {easier to read}<br>
        (2 + 3 &lt; 10 &amp;&amp; 75 % 12 != 12) {harder to read}<br>
      </p>
      <p><font size="+2">G. <u>The if-else Statements</u></font>
      <p>1. The general syntax of the if-else statement is as follows:
      <pre>    <b>if</b> (expression)
         statement1;
    <b>else</b>
         statement2;<br>
</pre>
      2. <b>if</b> statements may omit the <b>else</b> option which result in 
      one-way selection. 
      <pre>    <b>if</b> (expression)
         statement1;</pre>
      <p> If the expression is <b>true</b>, the statement is executed, otherwise 
        nothing is executed. The following flowchart illustrates the flow of control.<br>
        <img src="fig1.jpg" width="202" height="153"> </p>
      <p>3. The full <b>if-else</b> statement allows for two-way control. If the 
        value of the expression is true, statement1 is executed. If the value 
        of the expression equals false, the <b>else</b> option results in statement2 
        being executed. The following flowchart from handout, H.A.8.2, illustrates 
        the flow of control.<br>
        <img src="fig2.jpg" width="308" height="236"> </p>
      <p>4. The expression being tested must always be placed in parentheses. 
        This is a common source of syntax errors.</p>
      <p>5. Note that a semicolon must be placed after statement1, if the <b>else</b> 
        option is used.<br>
      </p>
      <p><font size="+2"><u>H. Compound Statements </u></font></p>
      <p>1. The statement executed in a control structure can be a block of statements, 
        grouped together into a single compound statement.</p>
      <p>2. A compound statement is created by enclosing any number of single 
        statements by braces as shown in the following example:<br>
      </p>
      <pre>if (expression)<br>{<br>  statement1;<br>  statement2;<br>  statement3;<br>}<br>else<br>{
  statement4;<br>  statement5;<br>  statement6;<br>}</pre>
      <p><u>I. Nested if-else Statements</u></p>
      <p>1. The statement inside of an <b>if</b> or <b>else</b> option can be 
        another <b>if-else</b> statement. Placing an <b>if-else</b> inside another 
        is known as nested <b>if-else</b> constructions. For example:<br>
        
      <pre>if (expression1)
    if (expression2)
        statement1;<br>    else
        statement2;
    else
        statement3;</pre>
      2. The <b>else</b> option will be paired with the nearest unpaired <b>if</b>. 
      Statement2 is the alternative action of the inner <b>if</b>, while statement3 
      is the alternative action of the outer <b>if</b>. 
      <p>3. The above example has three possible different outcomes as shown in 
        the following chart:<br>
      </p>
      <table border="1" align="center">
        <tr> 
          <td> 
            <div align="center"><b>expression 1</b></div>
          </td>
          <td> 
            <div align="center"><b>expression2</b></div>
          </td>
          <td> 
            <div align="center"><b>statement executed</b></div>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td> 
            <div align="center">true </div>
          </td>
          <td> 
            <div align="center">true </div>
          </td>
          <td> 
            <div align="center">statement1</div>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td> 
            <div align="center">true</div>
          </td>
          <td> 
            <div align="center">false</div>
          </td>
          <td> 
            <div align="center">statement2</div>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td> 
            <div align="center">false</div>
          </td>
          <td> 
            <div align="center">true</div>
          </td>
          <td> 
            <div align="center">statement3</div>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td> 
            <div align="center">false</div>
          </td>
          <td> 
            <div align="center">false</div>
          </td>
          <td> 
            <div align="center">statement3</div>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>4. Caution must be shown when using <b>else</b> statements inside of 
        nested <b>if-else</b> structures. For example:</p>
      <p>
      <pre><b>if</b> (expression1)
    <b>if</b> (expression2)
        statement1;<br><b>else</b>
    statement2;</pre>
      Indentation is ignored by the compiler, hence it will pair the <b>else</b> 
      statement with the inner if. If you want the <b>else</b> to get paired with 
      the outer <b>if</b> as the indentation indicates, you need to add braces:<br>
      <pre><b>if</b> (expression1)
{
<b>   if</b>(expression2)
		statement1;
}
<b>else</b>
	statement;
</pre>
      <p>The braces allow the else statement to be paired with the outer <b>if</b>.</p>
      <p>5. Another alternative to the example in Section 4. makes use of the 
        &amp;&amp; operator. A pair of nested <b>if</b> statements can be coded 
        as a single compound &amp;&amp; statement.<br>
      <Pre>if (expression1 && expression2)
	statement1;
else
	statement2;</pre>
      6. The most common and effective use of nested <b>if-else</b> statements 
      is called an <b>if-else</b> chain. See the following formatting styles:
      <table width="75%" border="0">
        <tr>
          <td width="54%">Formatting style 1</td>
          <td width="46%">Formatting style 2</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <br>
      <table width="75%" border="1">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre><b>if</b> (expression1)
 	statement1;
<b>else</b>	
     <b>if</b> (expression2)
			statement2;	
	<b>	else</b>
	<b>if	</b> (expression3)
			statement3;
	<b>	else</b>
			statement4;</pre>
          </td>
          <td>
            <pre><b>if</b> (expression1)
	 	statement1;
<b>else if</b> (expression2)
		statement2;
<b>else if</b> (expression3)
		statement3;
<b>else</b>
		statement4;</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Notice that each successive <b>if-else</b> statement is buried deeper 
        in the overall structure. Statement4 will only be executed if the first 
        three expressions are zero (false). </p>
      <p>7. Formatting style 1 lines up the <b>if</b> with its counterpart <b>else</b> 
        keyword. This makes it easy to check syntax but the indentation can get 
        rather deep. Formatting style 2 is a more compact version but you need 
        to be careful about which <b>else</b> statement belongs to which <b>if</b>. 
        Formatting style 1 is more appropriate if the statements are compound 
        statements. Formatting style 2 is appropriate if the statements are single-line 
        statements.<br>
      </p>
      <p>8. The advantage of such an <b>if-else</b> chain is efficiency in execution. 
        If a non-zero value (true) is encountered at any level, that statement 
        is executed and the rest of the structure is ignored.</p>
      <p>9. Consider the following example of determining the type of triangle 
        given the three sides A, B, and C.<br>
		
      <pre><b>if</b> ( (A  == B) && (B == C) )
	System.out.println("Equilateral triangle");
<b>else  if</b> ( (A == B) || (B == C) || (A == C) )
	System.out.println("Isosceles triangle");
<b>else</b>
	System.out.println("Scalene triangle");</pre>
      <p>If an equilateral triangle is encountered, the rest of the code is ignored. 
        Such a chain is best constructed by placing the most demanding case at 
        the top and the least demanding case at the bottom.<br>
      </p>
      <p><u>J. Conditional Operator (optional) </u></p>
      <p>1. Java provides an alternate method of coding an <b>if-else </b>statement 
        using the conditional operator. This operator is the only ternary operator 
        in Java as it requires three operands. The general syntax is:</p>
      <pre> (condition) ? statement1 : statement2;</pre>
      <p>2. If the condition is <b>true</b>, statement1 is executed. If the condition 
        is <b>false</b>, statement2 is executed.</p>
      <p>3. This is appropriate in situations where the conditions and statements 
        are fairly compact.</p>
      <pre><b>int</b> max (int a, int b) // returns the larger of two integers
{
   (a &gt; b) ? return a : return b;
}
</pre>
      <u>K. Boolean Identifiers</u> 
      <p>1. The execution of<b> if-else </b>statements depends on the value of 
        the Boolean expression. We can use <b>boolean</b> variables to write code 
        that is easier to read. </p>
      <p>2. For example, the <b>boolean</b> variable done could be used to write 
        code which is more English-like.</p>
      <p> Instead of<br>
      <pre><b>if</b> (done == <b>true</b>)  
  System.out.println("We are done!");

	we can write

<b>if</b> (done) 
  System.out.println("We are done!");<br></pre>
      <p>3. Using Boolean identifiers with conditional loops allows a separation 
        of solving expressions from thinking about program control. Here is an 
        example solution using the <b>while</b> control structure (to be covered 
        in the next lesson), presented in a blend of Java and pseudocode:<br>
        
      <pre><b>boolean</b> done = false;

<b>while</b> (!done)
        do some code which could change the value of done</pre>
      <p>4. Where appropriate you are encouraged to use <b>boolean</b> variables 
        to aid in program flow and readability. </p>

      <p>Control structures are a fundamental part of high level languages. Fluency 
        in any high level language only comes with practice. You will need to 
        practice control structures in Java as well as all other aspects of the
