        <p align="left">Suppose you were trapped in a maze and you needed to find 
          your way out. Your initial attempts are random and due to the same appearance 
          of the white walls, you begin wasting time and energy trying the same 
          routes over and over. After some thought and remembering a computer 
          science algorithm, you take advantage of a tool in your pocket, a marking 
          pen. You begin marking the walls with some notes and a time stamp. At 
          each branch point, you mark the direction you are about to attempt with 
          an arrow. If a dead-end is encountered just around the corner, you retreat 
          to the branch point, mark &quot;dead-end&quot; for that direction, and 
          try another direction. By marking which directions have failed, you 
          avoid trying them again. This 2 dimensional problem and the required 
          backtracking leads us to a recursive matrix problem! After defining 
          the problem, an entire solution will be covered in the outline. Your 
          programming exercise will also be a recursive matrix problem.</p>
        <p> The maze searching problem is translated from, Oh! Pascal!, 2nd edition.

        <p><font size=+2><u>A. Defining the Maze Problem</u></font></p>
        <p>1. The maze will be defined as a 2-D grid of asterisks (marking walls) 
          and blanks (marking potential paths). The size of the grid will be 12 
          x 12 and the starting location will be at 6, 6.</p>
        <p>2. The data structure for this problem will be an 2 dimensional array 
          of char. The array will be declared as a 13 x 13 grid so that we can 
          use locations 1..12 by 1..12. Row 0 and column 0 will not be used in 
          the data structure.</p>
        <p>3. The initial grid is stored as a text file and will be loaded into 
          the array.<br>
        </p>

        <p>4. A potential path out of the maze will be traced with a !, with moves 
          limited to horizontal or vertical directions.</p>
        <p>5. We will be at an exit point if we arrive at row 1 or MAXROW, or 
          at column 1 or MAXCOL.</p>
        <p>6. The solution is a backtracking algorithm involving a series of trial 
          and error attempts. If a dead-end is hit, back up and try a different 
          direction.<br>
        </p>
        <p><font size=+2><u>B. Developing the Recursive Solution</u></font></p>
        <p>1. In developing a recursive solution, consider the base cases first. 
          What situation(s) cause the algorithm to stop?<br>
          a. We have arrived at a location which is off the data structure. It 
          is important to catch this situation first to avoid an array indexing 
          error.<br>
          b. Encountering a '*' character means that we have run into a wall. 
          The algorithm should stop.<br>
          c. Arriving at a location which has a row or column value equal to 1 
          or MAXROW or MAXCOL. We have found an exit point.</p>
        <p>2. The general case of encountering a blank space requires the following 
          steps:<br>
          a. Change the character value from the blank space to the '!' character.<br>
          b. Check to see if we are at an exit point. If we are, print the maze 
          with a trail of '!' markers to the exit point.<br>
          c. If we are not at an exit point, make 4 recursive calls to check all 
          4 directions, feeding the new coordinates of the 4 neighboring cells.</p>
        <p>3. When a recursive call is made, a value parameter will be used in 
          the formal parameter list of the function. Each recursive call will 
          work with a copy of the array. Why is this? If a reference parameter 
          was used the placement of ! marks would be permanent in the data structure. 
          However, when an exit point is found we want to print only the successful 
          trail of ! marks which leads to an exit.</p>

        <p>1. It is very significant that a blank space be changed to an '!' mark 
          before the recursive calls are made. For example, suppose we begin at 
          location 6,6 and a blank space is encountered. If we did not change 
          the blank to an '!' mark, the recursive call to solve the upward direction 
          receives the location 5,6. This recursive call will eventually look 
          back down at location 6,6 - the location where it came from. A blank 
          space would still be there and the recursive calls would go round in 
          circles until the computer runs out of memory.</p>
        <p>2. Changing the blank space to an '!' mark is like leaving a trail 
          of markers. When a recursive call of a neighboring cell looks back at 
          the cell from which it came it will see a '!' mark and not a blank space.

        <p align="left">Some of the earlier examples of recursion were applied 
          to linear problems. The factorial or Fibonacci problems were one dimensional, 
          which required only one recursive call within the algorithm. The maze 
          problem is best solved recursively because of the different directions 
          that the problem solving takes. Loosely stated, any problem that involves 
          multiple directions and returning to a branch point is a likely candidate 
          for recursion.
