        <p align="left">Quicksort is another recursive sorting algorithm that 
          works by dividing lists in half. Whereas mergesort divided lists in 
          half and then sorts each sublist, quicksort will roughly sort the entire 
          list, and then split the list in half. The order of these two sorts 
          falls into a new category, O(N * log N). When the lists become large, 
          either of these sorts will do an excellent job.</p>

        <p>1. Here is the overall strategy of quicksort:<br>
          a. Quicksort chooses an arbitrary value from somewhere in the list. 
          A common location is the middle value of the list.<br>
          b. This value becomes a decision point for roughly sorting the list 
          into two sublists. All the values smaller than the dividing value end 
          up in the left sublist, while all the values greater than the dividing 
          value end up in the right sublist.<br>
          c. Each sublist is then recursively sorted with quicksort.<br>
          d. The termination of quicksort occurs when a list of one value is obtained, 
          which by definition is sorted.</p>
        <p>2. This is the code for quicksort:<br>
        <pre><b>void</b> quickSort (<b>int</b>[] list, <b>int</b> first, <b>int</b> last)
{
	<b>int</b> g = first, h = last;
  <b>int</b> midIndex, dividingValue, temp;

  midIndex = (first + last) / 2;
  dividingValue = list[midIndex];
  <b>do</b>
  {
    <b>while</b> (list[g] < dividingValue) g++;
    <b>while</b> (list[h] > dividingValue) h--;
    <b>if</b> (g <= h)
    {
      //swap(list[g], list[h]);
      <b>int</b> temp = list[g];
      list[g] = list[h];
      list[h] = temp;
      g++;
      h--;
    }
  }
  <b>while</b> (g < h);
  <b>if</b> (h > first) quickSort (list,first,h);
  <b>if</b> (g < last) quickSort (list,g,last);
}</pre>
        <p> 3. Suppose we have the following list of 9 unsorted values in an array:</p>
        <p>17 22 34 28 19 84 11 92 1</p>
        <p>a. The values received by the formal parameter <code>list</code> in 
          the first call of <code>quicksort</code> are a reference to an array, 
          1, and 9. Variable first is initialized with the value 1, and last is 
          initialized with the value 9.</p>
        <p>b. The <code>midIndex</code> value is calculated as (1+9) / 2, which 
          equals 5.</p>
        <p>c. The <code>dividingValue</code> is the value in location 5, list[5] 
          = 19.</p>
        <p>d. The value of 19 will be our decision point for sorting values into 
          two lists. The list to the left will contain all the values less than 
          or equal to 19. The list the right will contain the values larger than 
          or equal to 19. Or simply put, small values go to the left and large 
          values go to the right.</p>
        <p>e. The identifiers g and h will be indices to locations in the list. 
          The while loops will move g and h until a value is found to be on the 
          wrong side of the dividing value of 19. The g index is initialized with 
          the value of first and the h index is initialized with the value of 
          last. </p>
        <p>f. The g index starts at position 1 and moves until it &quot;sees&quot; 
          that 22 is on the wrong side. Index g stops at location 2. </p>
        <p>g. The h index starts at position 9. Immediately it &quot;sees&quot; 
          that the value 1 is on the wrong side. Index h never moves and stays 
          at position 9 of the array.</p>
        <p>h. Since g &lt;= h (2 &lt;= 9), the values in list[2] and list[9] are 
          swapped. After the values are swapped, index g moves one position to 
          the right and index h moves one position to the left. </p>
        <p>i. The values of the pointers are now: g = 3, h = 8. We continue the 
          do-while loop until g and h have passed each other, that is when g &lt; 
          h. At this point, the lists will be roughly sorted, with values smaller 
          than 19 on the left, and values greater than 19 on the right.</p>
        <p><br>
          j. If the left sublist has more than one value, (which is determined 
          by the h &gt; first expression), then a recursive call of quicksort 
          is made. This call of quicksort will send the index positions which 
          define that smaller sublist.</p>
        <p>k. Likewise, if the right sublist has more than one value, quicksort 
          is called again and the index positions which define that sublist are 
          passed.</p>
        <p><font size=+2><u>B. Order of Quicksort </u></font></p>
        <p>1. Determining the order of quicksort, O (N*log2N), is a difficult 
          process. The best way to understand it is to imagine a hypothetical 
          situation where each call of quicksort results in even sublists.</p>
        <p>2. If a list has 128 elements, the number of calls of quicksort required 
          to move a value into its correct spot is log2128, which equals 7 steps. 
          Dividing the list in half gives us the log2N aspect of quicksort.
        <p>3. But we need to do this to 128 numbers, so the approximate number 
          of steps to sort 128 numbers will be 128 * log2 128. <br>
          A general expression of the order of quicksort will be <br>
          O(N * log2N). An O(N * log2N) algorithm is a more specific designation 
          of the broader category called O(N * log N). </p>
        <p>4. A graph of an O(N*log2N) algorithm is very close to a linear algorithm. 
          The log2N number of steps grows very slowly making quicksort a dramatic 
          improvement over the O(N2) sorts.<br>

        <p align="left">Quicksort is generally the fastest and therefore most 
          widely used sorting algorithm. There is a variation of quicksort named 
          &quot;quickersort&quot; but it is still in the same class of algorithms. 
          Once again, recursion makes fast work of a difficult task.
