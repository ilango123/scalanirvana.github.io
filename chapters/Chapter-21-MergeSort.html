        <p align="left">In Chapter 21, we studied the quadratic sorting algorithms. 
          We saw how the number of steps required increased as an N2 factor when 
          sorting N elements. In the next two lessons we will study two recursive 
          sorts, mergesort and quicksort, which work by dividing lists in half. 
          In this lesson, after solving a preliminary merge problem, you will 
          code a recursive mergesort.</p>

        <p><font size=+2><u>A. A Merge Algorithm</u></font></p>
        <p>1. The mergesort algorithm requires a merge algorithm which we will 
          solve first.</p>
        <p>2. The method header and the specifications of the merge routine are 
          given below. You may assume the array definitions from the sorting template 
          program in Chapter 21 apply.<br>
        <pre>

/* Preconditions: Lists A and B are sorted in nondecreasing
                  order.
   Action: Lists A and B are merged into one list, C.
   Postcondition: List C contains all the values from
                  Lists A and B, in nondecreasing order.
 */
<b>void</b> merge (<b>int</b>[] A, <b>int</b>[] B, <b>int</b>[] C)
</pre>
        <p> <br>
          3. The <code>merge</code> method breaks down into four cases:<br>
          a. List A is done, so pull a value from List B.<br>
          b. List B is done, so pull a value from List A.<br>
          c. Neither is done, and if List<code> A[i] </code>&lt; List <code>B[j]</code> 
          (where i &amp; j are index markers in lists A and B) then pull from 
          List A.<br>
          d. Neither is done, and if List <code>B[j]</code>&lt;= List <code>A[i]</code> 
          then pull from List B.</p>
        <p>4. It is important to deal with the four cases in the order described 
          above. For example, if you are done with List A (if i &gt; A.length-1), 
          you do not want to inspect any values past A[i].<br>
        </p>
        <p>5. Example of method Merge:</p>
        <p>A: 2 6 11 15 21</p>
        <p>B: 4 5 9 13 17 25 29</p>
        <p>C: 2 4 5 6 9 11 13 15 17 21 25 29<br>
        </p>
        <p><font size=+2><u>B. A Hybrid Sort (Merge with Selectionsort)</u></font></p>
        <p>1. The overall logic of mergesort is to &quot;divide and conquer.&quot; 
          Before we look at a recursive mergsort, let's investigate a hybrid sort that
          takes a list of random integers, splits them into two equal-sized lists (each 
          with the same number of elements, plus or minus one), with each half-list 
          sorted independently of the other. The next step will be to merge the 
          two sorted sublists back into one sorted list.</p>
        <p>2. Here is the method, combining merge with a selectionsort:<br>
        <pre>

/* List A is unsorted, with A.length values in the array.
   first is the index position of the first value, last
   is the index position of the last value in the array;
   first < last. */
<b>void</b> DivideSort (<b>int</b> A[], <b>int</b> first, <b>int</b> last)
{
  <b>int</b>  mid;

  mid = (first + last) / 2;
  selectionSort (A, first, mid);
  selectionSort (A, mid+1, last);
  merge (A, first, mid, last);
}</pre>
        <p>3. A modified selection sort would have to be written to sort a range 
          of values in list A. Likewise, the merge method will also have to be 
          modified to internally merge two halves of the array into one ordered 
          array.</p>
        <p>4. The following example will illustrate the action of the above method
        on a list of 8 values:</p>
        <p><img src="fig1.jpg" width="396" height="180"></p>
        <p>5. Merging the two halves of the array in the modified merge method 
          will require the use of a local temporary array. Because the two sublists 
          are stored within one array, the easiest approach is to merge the two 
          sublists into another array, then copy the temp array back to the original.</p>
        <p><img src="fig2.jpg" width="425" height="114"></p>
        <p>Then copy Temp back into List A:</p>
        <p><img src="fig3.jpg" width="425" height="114"></p>
        <p>6. This version of merge will need to be able to work with sections 
          of List A. Here is a proposed method parameter list for <code>merge</code>:<br>
        <pre>

/* will merge the two sorted sublists within A into
   one continuous sublist from A[first] .. A[last].
   The left list ranges from A[first]..A[mid].  The
   right list ranges from A[mid+1]..A[last].
 */
<b>void</b> merge (<b>int</b> A[], <b>int</b> first, <b>int</b> mid, <b>int</b> last)
</pre>
        <p>7. You will need to write the code for this version of the merge method 
          to support a recursive mergesort.</p>
        <p><font size=+2><u>C. Recursive Mergesort</u></font></p>
        <p>1. Instead of dividing the list once, a recursive mergesort will keep 
          dividing the list in half until the sublists are one or two values in 
          length.</p>
        <p>2. When developing a recursive solution, a key step is identifying 
          the base case of the solution. What situation will terminate the recursion? 
          In this case, a sublist of one or two values will be our two base cases.</p>
        <p>3. Let's try and work through the recursive mergesort of a list of 
          eight values.<br>
        </p>
        <img src="fig4.jpg" width="332" height="45"> 
        <p>The list is divided into two sublists.</p>
        <p><img src="fig5.jpg" width="359" height="45"></p>
        <p>Now let's work on the left sublist. It will be divided into lists of 
          two.</p>
        <p><img src="fig6.jpg" width="195" height="48"></p>
        <p>Each list of two is now very easy to sort. After each list of two is 
          sorted, we then merge these two lists back into a list of four.</p>
        <p><img src="fig7.jpg" width="195" height="182"></p>
        <p>Now the algorithm proceeds to solve the right sublist (positions 5-8) 
          recursively. Then the two lists of four are merged back together.</p>
        <p><img src="fig8.jpg" width="372" height="304"><br>
        </p>
        <p><font size=+2><u>D. Order of Recursive Mergesort</u></font></p>
        <p>1. Suppose we have a list of 8 numbers. If we trace the migration of 
          one value, it will be a member of the following sizes of lists: eight, 
          four, two. The number of calls of mergesort needed to sort one value 
          into its final resting spot is log2N. If N = 8, then it will take three 
          calls of the algorithm for one value to find its final resting spot.</p>
        <p>2. We must apply log2N steps to N elements in the list. The order of 
          recursive Mergesort is O(N * log2N) or O(N * log N).</p>
        <p>3. What about the cost of merging the fragments of the list? The merge 
          algorithm is a linear one, so when combined with the Mergesort routine 
          we have a O (N * log N) + O(N), which remains in the category of an 
          O(N * log N) algorithm.<br>

        <p align="left">When you time and graph the recursive mergesort you will 
          notice a dramatic change in efficiency. This concept of dividing the 
          problem in two is used in several other classic algorithms. Once again, 
          recursion makes it easier to define a problem and code the solution.
