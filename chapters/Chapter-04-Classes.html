  <P><FONT size=+2>A. <U>Designing a Class</U></FONT></P>
  <P>1.	One of the advantages of object-oriented design is it allows a programmer 
	to create a new abstract data type, which is reusable in other situations.
  </P>
  <P>2.	When designing a new data type, two components must be identified - 
	attributes and behaviors.
  </P>
  <P>3.	Consider the icons used in computer operating systems.  The attributes that 
	describe the icon are things like a graphic pattern, colors, size, name, and 
	its position on the screen.  Some of its behaviors would include renaming and 
	moving its position.
  </P>
  <P>4.	The attributes of an object are the nouns that describe that object.  These 
	will become the private data members of a class.
  </P>
  <P>5.	The behaviors of an object are the verbs that denote the actions of that 
	object or what it does.  These will become the member functions of a class.  
  </P>
  
  <P><FONT size=+2>B. &nbsp;<U>Determining Object Behavior</U></FONT></P>
  <P>1.	In this section, you will learn how to create a simple class that describes 
	the behavior of a bank account. Before you start programming, you need to 
	understand how the objects of your class behave. Operations that can be 
	carried out with a checking account could consist of:
	<p><li>Accept a deposit
	<li>Process a check
	<li>Get the current balance
  <p></P>
  <P>2.	In Java, these operations are expressed as method calls. For example, 
	assume we have an object checking of type CheckingAccount. The methods that 
	invoke the required behaviors<p>
  <pre>
	checking.processDeposit(1000)
	checking.processCheck(250)
	System.out.println("Balance: " + checking.getBalance());
</pre>
	These methods form the behavior of the CheckingAccount class. The behavior is 
	the complete list of the methods that you can apply to objects of a given class. 
	An object of type CheckingAccount can be viewed as a “black box” that can carry 
	out its methods.
  <p></P>
  <P>3.	To construct objects of the CheckingAccount class, it is necessary to declare 
	an object variable
<pre>CheckingAccount checking;</pre>
	Object variables such as checking  are references to objects. Instead of 
	holding an object itself, a reference variable holds the information necessary 
	to find the object in memory.
  <p></P>
  <P>4.	This object variable checking does not refer to any object at all. An attempt 
	to invoke a method on this variable would cause the compiler to generate an 
	error indicating that the variable had not been initialized. To initialize the 
	variable, it is necessary to create a <b>new</b> CheckingAccount object using 
	the new operator
<pre>checking = new CheckingAccount();</pre>
	This call creates a new object and returns a reference to the newly created 
	object. To use an object, you must assign that reference to an object variable.
  <p></P>
  <P>5. We will implement the CheckingAccount so that a newly created account has an 
	initial balance of 1000.0 dollars.
  <pre> // open a new account
double initialDeposit = 1000.0;
CheckingAccount checking = new CheckingAccount();

// set initial balance to 1000.0
checking.processDeposit(intialDeposit);
</pre>
<img src="fig6.jpg">
  <P>6. Objects of the CheckingAccount class can be used to carry out meaningful tasks 
	without knowing how the CheckingAccount objects store their data or how the 
	CheckingAccount methods do their work. This is an important aspect of object-
	oriented programming.
  </P>
  <P>7. Once we understand how to use objects of the CheckingAccount class, it is 
	possible to design a Java class that implements its behaviors. To describe 
	object behavior, you need to implement a class.
<pre>
public class CheckingAccount   {
   // CheckingAccount data

   // CheckingAccount constructors

   // CheckingAccount methods
}
</pre>
Three methods have already been identified
<pre>
public class CheckingAccount   {
   // CheckingAccount data

   // CheckingAccount constructors

   public double getBalance()   {
      // method implementation
   }

   public void processDeposit( double amount )   {
      // method implementation
   }

   public void processCheck( double amount )   {
      // method implementation
   }
}
</pre>
  <p></P>
<P>8. A method header consists of the following parts:<p>
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An <i>access specifier</i> (such as <b>public</b>). The access specifier controls which other
methods can call this method. Most methods should be declared as public so all other 
methods in your program can call them.<br>
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>return type</i> of the method (such as <b>double</b> or <b>void</b>). The return type is the type 
of the value that the method computes. For example, in the CheckingAccount class, the 
getBalance method returns the current account balance which is a floating-point number, 
so its return type is <b>double</b>. The processDeposit and processCheck methods don’t return 
any value. To indicate that a method does not return a value, you use the special type 
<b>void</b>.<br>
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the method (such as processDeposit).<br>
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A list of the parameters of the method. The parameters are the input to the method. 
The processDeposit and processCheck methods each have one parameter, the amount of money 
to deposit or withdraw. The type of parameter, such as <b>double</b>, and name for each 
parameter, such as amount, must be specified. If a method has no parameters, like 
getBalance, it is still necessary to supply a pair of parentheses () behind the method 
name.

  </P>
<P>9. Once the method header has been specified, the implementation of the method must 
be supplied in a block that is delimited by braces {...}. The CheckingAccount methods 
will be implemented later in Section D.
  </P>
  <P><FONT size=+2>C. &nbsp;<U>Instance Variables</U></FONT></P>
  <P>1. Each object must store its current state. The state is the set of values that 
describe the object and that influence how an object reacts to method calls. In the case 
of our checking account objects, the state is the current balance and an account 
identifier. 
  </P>
  <P>2. Each object stores its state in one or more <i>instance variables</i>.
  </P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;<U>Program 3-1</U></FONT></P>
  <PRE>
  public class CheckingAccount   {
     ...
     private double myBalance;
     private String myAccountNumber;

     // CheckingAccount methods
  }

  </PRE>
  <P>3. An instance variable declaration consists of the following parts:
  </P>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;An access specifier (such as private). Instance variables are generally declared 
with the access specifier <b>private</b>. That means, they can be accessed only by methods of 
the same class, not by any other method. In particular, the balance variable can be 
accessed only by the processDeposit, processCheck, and getBalance methods.<br>
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;The type of the variable (such as <b>double</b>).<br>
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the variable (such as myBalance).
<p><img src="fig6-2.jpg"></p>
<p>4.  If instance variables are declared private, then all data access must occur 
through the public methods. This means that the instance variables of an object are 
effectively hidden from the programmer who uses a class. They are only of concern 
to the programmer that implements the class. The process of hiding data is called 
encapsulation. Although it is possible in Java to define instance variables as <b>public</b> 
(leave them unencapsulated), it is very uncommon in practice. We will make all instance 
variables private in this curriculum guide.</p>
<p>5. For example, because the balance instance variable is <b>private</b>, the instance 
variable in other code cannot be accessed:<p>
<pre>double balance = checking.myBalance;  // compiler Error!</pre>
However, the public getBalance method to inquire about the balance can be called:<br>
<pre>double balance = checking.getBalance();  // OK</pre>
  <P><FONT size=+2>D. &nbsp;<U>Implementing Methods</U></FONT></P>
  <P>
  1. An implementation must be provided for every method of the class. The 
implementation for three methods of the CheckingAccount class is given below. 
  </P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;<U>Program 3-2</U></FONT></P>
  <PRE>
  public class CheckingAccount   {
     private double myBalance;
     private String myAccountNumber;

     public double getBalance()   {
        return myBalance;
     }

     public void processDeposit( double amount )   {
        myBalance =  myBalance + amount;
     }

     public void processCheck( double amount )   {
        myBalance =  myBalance – amount;
     }
  }

  </PRE>
  <P>2. The implementation of the methods is straightforward. When some amount of 
money is deposited or withdrawn, the balance increases or decreases by that amount. 
  </P>
  <P>3. The getBalance method simply returns the current balance. A <b>return</b> statement 
obtains the value that a method returns and exits the method immediately. The return 
value becomes the value of the method call expression. The syntax of a <b>return</b> 
statement is:
  </P>
  <PRE>
      return &lt;expression&gt;;
  </PRE>
  or
  <p></P>
  <PRE>
      return;
  </PRE>

  <P><FONT size=+2>E. &nbsp;<U>Constructors</U></FONT></P>
  <P>1. The final requirement to implement the CheckingAccount class is to define 
a constructor. The purpose of a constructor is to initialize the instance variables 
of an object.
  </P><pre>
public class CheckingAccount   {
    ...

    public CheckingAccount()   {
        myBalance = 0;
        myAccountNumber = "NEW";
    }
    ...
}
</pre>
  <P>2.	Constructors always have the same name as their class. Similar to methods, 
constructors are generally declared as public to enable any code in a program to 
construct new objects of the class. Unlike methods, constructors do not have return 
types.
  </P>
  <P>3. Constructors are always invoked together with the new operator:
<pre>new CheckingAccount();</pre>
The <b>new</b> operator allocates memory for the objects, and the constructor initializes it. 
The value of the new operator is the reference to the newly allocated and constructed object.
<p>
In most cases, you want to declare and store a reference to an object in an object variable as 
follows:
  </P>
  <PRE>
   CheckingAccount checking = new CheckingAccount();
  </PRE>
  <P>4. If  you do not initialize an instance variable that is a number, it is initialized 
automatically to zero. Even though initialization is handled automatically for instance variables, 
it’s a matter of good style to initialize every object’s instance variable(s) explicitly.
  </P>
  <p>5. An object variable is initialized to a special value called <b>null</b>, which indicates 
that an object variable does not yet refer to an actual object.
  </p>
6. Many classes have more than one constructor. For example, you can supply a second constructor 
for the CheckingAccount class that sets the balance and accountNumber instance variables to 
initial values, which are the parameters of the constructor:
  <PRE>
  public class CheckingAccount   {
       ...

       public CheckingAccount()   {
          myBalance = 0;
          myAccountNumber = "NEW";
       }

       public CheckingAccount(double initialBalance, String acctNum)   {
          myBalance = initialBalance;
          myAccountNumber = acctNum;
       }

       ...
  }
  </PRE>
The second constructor is used if you supply a number and a string as construction parameters.
<pre>CheckingAccount checking = new CheckingAccount(5000, "A123");</pre>
<p>6. Note that there are two constructors of the same name. Whenever you have 
multiple methods (or constructors) with the same name, the name is said to be overloaded. 
The compiler figures out which one to call by looking at the parameters.

For example, if you construct a new checkingAccount object with
<pre>CheckingAccount checking = new CheckingAccount();</pre>
then the compiler picks the first constructor. If you construct an object with
<pre>CheckingAccount checking = new CheckingAccount(5000, "A123");</pre>
then the compiler picks the second contructor.
<p>7.The implementation of the CheckingAccount class is complete and is given below:
<pre> <b>public class</b> CheckingAccount  {
  <b>private double</b> myBalance;
  <b>private</b> String myAccountNumber;

  <b>public</b> CheckingAccount()   {
    myBalance = 0;
    myAccountNumber = "NEW";
  }

  <b>public</b> CheckingAccount(double initialBalance, String acctNum)  {
    myBalance = initialBalance;
    myAccountNumber = acctNum;
  }

  <b>public double</b> getBalance()   {
    <b>return</b> myBalance;
  }

  <b>public void</b> processDeposit(<b>double</b> amount)  {
    myBalance =  myBalance + amount;
  }

  <b>public void</b> processCheck(double amount)   {
    myBalance =  myBalance – amount;
  }
}
</pre>
  <P><FONT size=+2>F. &nbsp;<U>Using Classes</U></FONT></P>
  <P>1. Using the CheckingAccount class is best demonstrated by writing a program that 
solves a specific problem. We want to study the following scenario: 
  </P>
  <P>
An interest bearing checking account is created with a balance of $1,000. For two years in a 
row, add 2.5% interest. How much money is in the account after two years? 

  <P>2. Two classes are required: the CheckingAccount class that was developed in the 
preceding sections, and a second class called CheckingAccountTester. The main method of the  
CheckingAccountTester class constructs a CheckingAccount object, adds the interest twice, then 
prints out the balance.	
<pre><p>class</p> CheckingAccountTester  {
  <p>public static void</p> main( String[] args )  {
    CheckingAccount checking =
      <b>new</b> CheckingAccount("A123", 1000);

    <b>final double</b> INTEREST_RATE = 2.5;
    <b>double</b> interest;
    
    interest = checking.getBalance() * INTEREST_RATE / 100;
    checking.processDeposit(interest);

    System.out.println("Balance after year 1 is $"
        + checking.getBalance());

    interest = account.getBalance() * INTEREST_RATE / 100;
    checking.processDeposit(interest);
   
    System.out.println("Balance after year 2 is $"
        + checking.getBalance());
  }
}
</pre>
  <p></P>
  <P>3. The classes can be distributed over multiple files or kept together in a single file. 
If kept together, the class with the main  method must be declared as <b>public</b>. The <b>public</b> 
attribute cannot be specified for any other class in the same file since a Java source file can 
contain only one <b>public</b> class.
  </P>
  <P>4. Care must be taken to ensure that the name of the file matches the name of the  public 
class. For example, a single file containing both the CheckingAccount class and the 
CheckingAccountTester class must be contained in a file called CheckingAccountTester.java, not 
CheckingAccount.java.

  <P>The topics in this lesson are critical in your study of computer science.  The concepts 
of abstraction and object-oriented programming (OOP) will continue to be developed in future 
lessons. Before you solve the lab exercise, you are encouraged to play with the CheckingAccount 
class and implement objects using all the behaviors of the class.
