        <p><font size=+2><u>A. Primitive Data Type Variables</u></font></p>
        <p>1. Java has many data types built into it, and you (as a programmer) 
          can define as many more as you need. Other than the primitive data types, 
          all data types are classes. In other words, data is primitive data or 
          object data. The only type of data a programmer can define is an object 
          data type (a class).</p>
        <p>2. Here is a tiny program that uses a primitive data type:<br>
        <pre><br><b>class</b> pimitiveDataType
{
  <b>public static void</b> main(String[] args)
  {
    <b>long</b> value;

    primitiveValue = 95124;
    System.out.println(primitiveValue);
  }
}</pre>
        <p>In this program, the variable value is the name for a 64 bit section 
          of memory that is used to hold long integers. The statement <br>
          <code>primitiveValue = 95124;</code><br>
          puts a particular bit pattern in that 64 bit section of memory.</p>
        <p>4. With primitive data types, a variable is a section of memory reserved 
          for a value of a particular style. For example by saying <b>long</b> 
          value, 64 bits of memory are reserved for an integer. By saying <b>int</b> 
          sum, 32 bits of memory are reserved an integer.<br>
        </p>
        <p><font size=+2><u>B. Object Reference variables</u></font></p>
        <p>1. Since objects are big, complicated, and vary in size you do not 
          automatically get an object when you declare an object reference variable. 
          All you get is a name for a future object. For example:</p>
        <p>2. Here is a tiny program that uses a primitive data type:</p>
        <pre>class StrRefExample<br>{<br>  public static void main (String[] args)<br>  {<br>    String str;<br>    <br>    str = new String(&quot;example string&quot;);<br>    System.out.println(str);<br>  }<br>}<br></pre>
        <p>3. An object contains data and methods (state and behavior). You can 
          visualize the String object in the above program like this: <br>
          <img src="fig1.jpg" width="475" height="205" border="0"> </p>
        <p>The data section of the object contains the characters. The methods 
          section of the object contains many methods.</p>
        <p>4. An object reference is information on how to find a particular object. 
          The object is a chunk of main memory; a reference to the object is a 
          way to get to that chunk of memory. The variable str does not actually 
          contain the object, but contains information about where the object 
          is.<br>
        </p>
        <p>5. Objects are created while a program is running. Each object has 
          a unique object reference, which is used to find it. When an object 
          reference is assigned to a variable, then that variable says how to 
          find that object.<br>
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p><font size=+2><u>C. Variable Versus Object Reference Assignment</u></font></p>
        <p>1. Notice that there is a difference between the two statements: </p>
        <p><code>primitiveValue = 18234;</code></p>
        <p>and</p>
        <p><code>str = new String(&quot;example string&quot;);</code></p>
        <p>In the first statement, <code>primitiveValue</code> is a primitive 
          type, so the assignment statement puts the data directly into it. In 
          the second statement, <code>str</code> is an object reference variable 
          (the only other possibility) so a reference to the object is put into 
          that variable.</p>
        <p>2. A variable will<i> never</i> contain an object. There are only primitive 
          variables and object reference variables, and each contains a specific 
          kind of information:<br>
        </p>
        <table width="100%" border="1">
          <tr> 
            <td width="24%"> 
              <div align="center"><b>Kind of Variable</b></div>
            </td>
            <td width="34%"> 
              <div align="center"><b>Information it Contains</b></div>
            </td>
            <td width="42%"> 
              <div align="center"><b>When on the left of &quot;=&quot;</b></div>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr> 
            <td width="24%"> 
              <div align="center">primitive variable</div>
            </td>
            <td width="34%"> 
              <div align="center">Contains actual data</div>
            </td>
            <td width="42%"> 
              <div align="center">Previous data is replaced with new data.</div>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr> 
            <td width="24%"> 
              <div align="center">reference variable</div>
            </td>
            <td width="34%"> 
              <div align="center">Contains information on how to find an object.</div>
            </td>
            <td width="42%"> 
              <div align="center">Old reference is replaced with a new reference</div>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>3. The two types of variable are distinguished by how they are declared. 
          Unless it was declared to be of a primitive type, it is an object reference 
          variable. A variable will not change its declared type.<br>
        </p>
        <p><font size=+2><u>D. Object References</u></font></p>
        <p> 1. It is possible to reassign an object reference to a new value. 
          For example:<br>
        <pre><b>class</b> OneStringReference
{
  <b>public</b> <b>static void</b> main (String[] args)
  {
    String str;
     
    str = <b>new</b> String("first string");
    System.out.println(str);

    str = <b>new</b> String("second string");
    System.out.println(str);
   }
}

Run Output:

first string
second string</pre>
        <p>2. Notice that: </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>a. Each time the new operator is used, a new object is created. <br>
            b. Each time an object is created, there is a reference to it. <br>
            c. This reference is saved in a variable. <br>
            d. Later on, the reference in the variable is used to find the object. 
            <br>
            e. If another reference is saved in the variable, it <i>replaces</i> 
            the previous reference. <br>
            f. If no variables hold a reference to an object, there is no way 
            to find it, and it becomes &quot;<i>garbage.</i>&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><img src="fig2.jpg" width="409" height="207"></p>
        <p>3. The word &quot;garbage&quot; is the correct term from computer science 
          to use for objects that have no references. This is a commonly occurring 
          situation, not usually a mistake. As a program executes, a part of the 
          Java system called the &quot;garbage collector&quot; reclaims the lost 
          objects (the &quot;garbage&quot;) so that their memory can be used again.</p>
        <p>4. Multiple objects of the same class can be maintained by creating 
          unique reference variables for each object.<br>
        </p>
        <pre><b>class</b> TwoStringReferences
{
  <b>public static void</b> main (String[] args)
  {
    String strA;  // reference to the first object
    String strB;  // reference to the second object

    // create the first object and save its reference     
    strA = <b>new</b> String("first string"); 

    // print data referenced by the first object.
    System.out.println(strA);
    
    // create the second object and save its reference
    strB = <b>new</b> String("second string");

    // print data referenced by the first object.
    System.out.println(strB);

    // print data referenced by the second object.
    System.out.println(strA);   
  }
}

Run Output:

first string
second string
first string</pre>
        <p>This program has two reference variables,<code> strA</code> and <code>strB</code>. 
          It creates two objects and places each reference in one of the variables. 
          Since each object has its own reference variable, no reference is lost, 
          and no object becomes garbage (until the program has finished running.)<br>
          <img src="fig3.jpg" width="397" height="223"></p>
        <p>5. Different reference variables that refer to the same object are 
          called <i>aliases</i>. In effect, there are two names for the same object. 
          For example:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;
        <pre>class Alias
{
  public static void main (String[] args)
  {
    String strA;  // reference to the object
    String strB;  // another reference to the object
    
    // Create the only object and save its
    //   reference in strA
    strA = new String("only one string");
    System.out.println(strA); 

    strB = strA;  // copy the reference to strB.                             
    System.out.println(strB);
  }
}

Run Output:

only one string
only one string</pre>
        <p><br>
          <img src="fig4.jpg" width="399" height="146"> </p>
        <p>When this program runs, only one object is created (by new). Information 
          about how to find the object is put into strA. The assignment operator 
          in the statement </p>
        <p><code>strB = strA; // copy the reference to strB.</code></p>
        <p>copies the information that is in strA to strB. It does not make a 
          copy of the object. </p>
        <p><font size="+2"><u>E. The == operator with Variables and Object References.</u></font><br>
        </p>
        <p>1. The == operator is used to look at the contents of two reference 
          variables. If the contents of both reference variables is the same, 
          then the result is<code> true</code>. Otherwise the result is<code> 
          false</code>. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;
        <pre>class EqualsEquals
{
  public static void main (String[] args)
  {
    String strA;  // reference to the first object
    String strB;  // reference to the second object
   
    // create the first object and save its reference
    strA = new String("same characters"); 
    System.out.println(strA); 

    // create the second object and save its reference
    strB = new String("same characters");   
    System.out.println(strB);

    if (strA == strB) 
      System.out.println("This will not print.");
  }
}

Run Output:

same characters
same characters</pre>
        <p>2. In this program, there are two completely separate objects, each 
          of which happens to contain character data equivalent to that in the 
          other. Each object consists of a section of main memory completely separate 
          from the memory that makes up the other object. The variable strA contains 
          information on how to find the first object, and the variable strB contains 
          information on how to find the second object</p>
        <p>Since the information in strA is different from the information in 
          strB, (strA == strB) is false, for the first comparison. Since there 
          are two objects, made out of two separate sections of main memory, the 
          reference stored in strA is different from the reference in strB. It 
          doesn't matter that the data inside the objects looks the same.<br>
        </p>
        <p><img src="fig5.jpg" width="394" height="195"></p>
        <p>3. The == operator does not look at objects. It only looks at references 
          (information about where an object is located.)</p>
        <p>4. For primitive types, the == operator looks only at the variables. 
          For example:<br>
        </p>
      <pre>int x = 32;
int y = 48;

if (x == y)                                // false, 32 != 48
  System.out.println("They are equal");

X = y;

if (x == y)                                // true, 48 == 48
  System.out.println("Now they are equal");

Run Output:

Now they are equal
</pre>
        <p>In this code, only the contents of the variables x and y are examined. 
          But with primitive types, the contents of a variable is the data, so 
          with primitive types == looks at data. </p>
        <p>5. With primitive and reference types, == looks at the contents of 
          the variables. However, with reference types, the variables contain 
          object references and with primitive types, the variables contain the 
          actual data values.<br>
        </p>
        <p><font size="+2"><u>F. The equals() Method. </u></font></p>
        1. You have previously seen the equals(String) method of class String. 
        The equals(String) method of class String tests if two Strings contain 
        the same characters.
        <p>2. The equals(String) method does look at the contents of objects. 
          It detects &quot;equivalence.&quot; The == operator detects &quot;identity&quot;. 
          For example,<br>
        </p>
      <pre>String strA;  // first object
String strB;  // second object
 
strA = new String("different object, same characters");   
strB = new String("different object, same characters ");   

if (strA == strB) 
  System.out.println("This will NOT print");

if (strA.equals(strB)) 
  System.out.println("This WILL print");

Run Output:

This WILL print
</pre>
        <p>3. In this example, there are two objects. Since each object has its 
          own identity, == reports false. Each object contains equivalent data 
          so equals() reports true.</p>
        <p><u><font size="+2">G. The null Value</font></u></p>
        <p>1. In most programs, objects are created and objects are destroyed, depending 
          on the data and on what is being computed. A reference variable sometimes 
          does and sometimes does not refer to an object. You need a way to say 
          that a variable does not now refer to an object. You do this by assigning 
          null to the variable.</p>
        <p>2. The value null is a special value that means &quot;no object.&quot; 
          A reference variable is set to null when it is not referring to any 
          object.<br>
        </p>
      <pre>class nullDemo
{
  public static void main (String[] arg)
  {
    String a = "abracadabra"; // 1. an object is created; 
                              //    variable a refers to it
    String b = null;          // 2. variable b refers to no
                              //    object.
    String c = "";            // 3. an object is created 
                              //    (containing no characters)
                              //     variable c refers to it
    if (a != null)            // 4. is true, so the
       System.out.println(a); // 5. the println(a) executes.
                                              
    if (b != null)            // 6. is false, so the
       System.out.println(b); // 7. println(b) is skipped.

    if (c != null)            // 8. is true, so the
       System.out.println(c); // 9. println(c) executes (but
                              //    it has no characters to 
                              //    print).
  }
}    

Run Output:

abracadabra
</pre>
        <p>3. Variables a and c are initialized to object references. Variable 
          b is initialized to null. Note that variable c is initialized to a <i>reference</i> 
          to a String object containing no characters. This is a different value 
          than null.</p>
