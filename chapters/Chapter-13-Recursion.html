        <p align="left">Recursion is defined as the process of a subprogram calling 
          itself as part of the solution to a problem. It is a problem solving 
          technique which can turn a long and difficult solution into a compact 
          and elegant answer. It can also solve problems that are very difficult 
          to solve with a straightforward iterative solution. </p>

        <p><font size=+2><u>A. Recursion</u></font></p>
        <p>1.Recursion occurs when a method calls itself to solve a simpler version 
          of the problem. With each recursive call, the problem is different from, 
          and simpler than, the original problem.</p>
        <p>2. Recursion involves the internal use of a stack. A stack is a data 
          abstraction which works like this: New data is &quot;pushed,&quot; or 
          added to the top of the stack. When information is removed from the 
          stack it is &quot;popped,&quot; or removed from the top of the stack. 
          The recursive calls of a method will be stored on a stack, and manipulated 
          in a similar manner.</p>
        <p>3. The problem of solving factorials is our first example of recursion. 
          The factorial operation in mathematics is illustrated below. <br>
        </p>
        <pre>1! = 1
	2! = 2 * 1		or 	2 * 1!
	3! = 3 * 2 * 1	or	3 * 2!
	4! = 4 * 3 * 2 *1	or	4 * 3!
</pre><p></p>
        <p>Notice that each successive line can be solved in terms of the previous 
          line. For example, 4! is equivalent to the problem <br>
          4 * 3!.</p>
        <p>A recursive method to solve the factorial problem is given below. Notice 
          in the last line of the method the recursive call. The method calls 
          another implementation of itself to solve a smaller version of the problem.<br>
        <pre><br><b>int</b> fact (<b>int </b>n)
//  returns the value of n!
//  precondition:  n >= 1
{
   <b>if</b> (n == 1)
      <b>return</b> 1;
 <b>  else</b>
     <b> return </b> n * fact(n - 1);
}
</pre>
        <p>4. The base case is a fundamental situation where no further problem 
          solving is necessary. In the case of finding factorials, the answer 
          of 1! is by definition == 1. No further work is needed.</p>
        <p>5. Suppose we call the method to solve fact(4). This will result in 
          four calls of method fact.</p>
        <p>fact(4): This is not the base case (1 == n), so we return the result 
          of 4 * fact(3). This multiplication will be solved until an answer is 
          found for fact(3). This leads to the second call of fact to solve fact(3).</p>
        <p>fact(3): Again, this is not the base case and we return <br>
          3 * fact (2). This leads to another recursive call to solve fact(2).</p>
        <p>fact(2): Still, this is not the base case, we solve 2 * fact(1).</p>
        <p>fact(1): Finally we reach the base case which returns the <br>
          value 1.</p>
        <p>6. When a recursive call is made, the current computation is temporarily 
          suspended and placed on the stack with all its current information available 
          for later use. </p>
        <p>7. A completely new copy of the method is used to evaluate the recursive 
          call. When that is completed, the value returned by the recursive call 
          is used to complete the suspended computation. The suspended computation 
          is removed from the stack and its work now proceeds.</p>
        <p>8. When the base case is encountered the recursion will now unwind 
          and result in a final answer. The expressions below should be read from 
          right to left.<br>
        </p>
        <pre>fact(4) = 4 * fact(3) = 3 * fact(2) = 2 * fact(1) = 1

24  4 * 6  3 * 2  2 * 1
</pre>
        <p>Here is a picture. Look at what happens:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="fig1.jpg" width="312" height="388"></p>
        <p>Each box represent a call of method fact. To solve fact (4) requires 
          four calls of method fact.</p>
        <p>9. Notice that when the recursive calls were made inside the else statement, 
          the value fed to the recursive call was (n-1). This is where the problem 
          is getting smaller and simpler with the eventual goal of solving 1!.<br>
        </p>
        <p><font size=+2><u>B. Pitfalls of Recursion</u></font></p>
        <p>1. If the recursion never reaches the base case, the recursive calls 
          will continue until the computer runs out of memory and the program 
          crashes. Experienced programmers try to examine the remains of a crash. 
          The message &quot;stack overflow error&quot; or &quot;heap storage exhaustion&quot; 
          indicates a possible runaway recursion.</p>
        <p>2. When programming recursively, you need to make sure that the algorithm 
          is moving toward the base case. Each successive call of the algorithm 
          must be solving a simpler version of the problem.</p>
        <p>3. Any recursive algorithm can be implemented iteratively, but sometimes 
          only with great difficulty. However, a recursive solution will always 
          run more slowly than an iterative one because of the overhead of opening 
          and closing the recursive calls.<br>
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p><font size=+2><u>C. Recursion Practice</u></font></p>
        <p>1. Write a recursive power method that raises a base to some exponent, 
          n. We will use integers to keep things simple.</p>
        <pre><b>double</b> power(<b>int</b> base, <b>int</b> n)<br>//  Recursively determines base raised to<br>//  the nth power. Assumes 0 &lt;= n &lt;= 10.<br></pre>

          Eventually you want to be able to think recursively without the aid 
          of props and handouts. Study the examples provided in these notes and 
          work it through for yourself. Recursion is a very powerful programming 
          tool for solving difficult problems.
