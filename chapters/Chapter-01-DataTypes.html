  <P><FONT size=+2>A. <U>Identifiers in Java</U></FONT></P>
  <P>1.	An identifier is a name that will be used to describe classes, 
  methods, constants, variables, and other items.
  </P>
  <P>2.	The rules for writing identifiers in Java are:<BR>
  a. &nbsp;Identifiers must begin with a letter.<BR>
  b. &nbsp;Only letters, digits, or underscore may follow the initial letter.<BR>
  c. &nbsp;The blank space cannot be used.<BR>
  d. &nbsp;Identifiers cannot be reserved words.  Reserved words or keywords are 
  identifiers reserved for system use.
  </P>
  <P>3.	Java is a case sensitive language.  Java will distinguish between upper 
  and lower case letters in identifiers.  Therefore:<BR><BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <B>grade</B> versus <B>Grade</B> are different identifiers
  </P>
  <P>4.	A good identifier should also be a mnemonic device which helps describe 
  the nature or purpose of that function or variable.  It is better to use<BR><BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <B>grade</B> instead of <B>g</B>,  <B>number</B> instead of <B>n</B>.
  </P>
  <P>Remember that our goal is to write code that is easy to read and professional 
  in nature.  </P>
  <P>5.	Programmers will adopt different styles of using upper and lower case 
  letters in writing identifiers.  The reserved keywords in Java must be typed 
  in lower case text, but identifiers can be typed using any combination of upper 
  and lower case letters.  
  </P>
  <P>6.	The following conventions will be used throughout the curriculum guide:<BR><BR>
  a. &nbsp;A single word identifier will be written in lower case only.  Examples:  
  <B>grade</B>, <B>number</B>, <B>sum</B>.<BR>
  b. If an identifier is made up of several words, the first letter will be 
  lower case.  Subsequent words will begin with upper case.  Some examples are:  
  <B>stringType</B>, <B>passingScore</B>, <B>largestNum</B>.<BR>
  c. Identifiers used as constants will be fully capitalized.  Examples:  
  <B>PI</B>, <B>MAXSTRLEN</B>.<BR>
  </P>
  <P><FONT size=+2>B. &nbsp;<U>Basic Data Types in Java</U></FONT></P>
  <P>1.	Java provides eight primitive data types:  <B>byte</B>, <B>short</B>, 
  <B>int</B>, <B>long</B>, <B>float</B>, <B>double</B>, <B>char</B> and a 
  <B>boolean</B>.</P>
  <P>a. The data types <B>byte</B>, <B>short</B>, <B>int</B>, and <B>long</B> are for integers.<br>
    b.
    The data types <B>float</B> and <B>double</B> are for real or &quot;floating point&quot; numbers. </P>
  <P>2.	Integer type - any positive or negative number without a decimal point.<BR><BR>
  Integer examples:  <B>7</B>, <B>-2</B>, <B>0</B>, <B>2025</B>
  </P>
  <P>3.	Floating Point type - any signed or unsigned number with a decimal point.
  <BR><BR>
  Floating point examples:  <B>7.5</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>-66.72</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<B>0.125</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <B>3f</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>28d</B></P>
  <P>A floating point value can be specified by<br>
    a.  a decimal point. e.g. <strong>5. </strong>, <strong>-3.1415</strong><br>
  b. an integer number appended by an f or F, d or D. e.g. <strong>2011f</strong>, <strong>-345d</strong><br>
  c. scientific notation. e.g. <strong>1625. = 1.625e3</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>.000125 = 1.25e-4</strong></P>
  <P>A floating point value <strong>cannot</strong>  contain a comma or $ symbol. e.g. <B>1,234.56</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>$66.95</B><BR>
  </P>
  <P>4.	The following table summarizes the bytes allocated and the resulting size.

  <P>5. Character type - letters, digits 0..9, and punctuation symbols.<BR><BR>
  a. &nbsp;Examples: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A', &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'a', 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'8', &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'*'<BR>
  b. &nbsp;Note that a character type must be enclosed within single quotes.<BR>
  c. &nbsp;Java character types are stored using 2 bytes, usually according to the ASCII 
  collating sequence.  ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange.<BR>
  d. &nbsp;The character value 'A' is actually stored as the integer value 65.  Because a 
  capital 'A' and the integer 65 are physically stored in the same fashion, this will allow 
  us to easily convert from character to integer types, and vice versa.<BR>
  e. &nbsp;Using the single quote as a delimiter leads to the question about how to assign 
  the single quote (') character to a variable.  Java  provides escape sequences for unusual 
  keystrokes on the keyboard.  Here is a partial list:<BR><BR>

  </P>
  <P>6. Data types are provided by high level languages to minimize memory usage and 
  processing time.  Integers and characters require less memory and are easier to process.  
  Floating point values require more memory and time to process.
  </P>
  <P>7. The final primitive  is the type <B>boolean</B>. It is used to represent a single 
  <B>true/false</B> value. A <B>boolean</B> value can have only one of two values:<BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>true</B>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>false</B><BR>
  In a Java program, the words <B>true</B> and <B>false</B> are reserved words that always mean these <B>boolean</B> values.
  </P>
  <P><FONT size=+2>C. &nbsp;<U>Declaring and Initializing Variables in Java</U></FONT></P>
  <P>1. A variable must be declared before it can be initialized with a value.  The general 
  syntax of variable declarations is:<BR><BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;datatype&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  &lt;variableName&gt;;<BR>
  </P>
  <P>2. Variables can be declared near the top of the method or in the midst of writing code. 
  Variables can also be declared and assigned a value in one line.  The following example program 
  illustrates these aspects of variable declaration and assignments.
  </P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;<U>Program 3-1</U></FONT></P>
  <PRE>
  public class DeclareVar  {
     public static void main(String[] args)  {
          // first is declared and initialized
          // second is just intialized
          int first, second; 
          double  x = 2.5;
          char  ch;
          bool  done;

          first = 5;
          second = 7;
          x = 2.5;
          ch = 'T';
          done = false;

          int sum = first + second;
     }
  }
  </PRE>
  <P>In Program 3-1, two variables, <strong>first</strong> and <strong>second</strong>, are declared on the same line, the variable <strong>x</strong> is declared and assigned the value <strong>2.5</strong>, and the variable <strong>sum</strong> is declared and assigned the computed value <strong>first + second</strong>.</P>
  <P>3. Where the variables are declared is a matter of programming style.  Your instructor 
  will probably have some preferences regarding this matter.
  </P>
  <P><FONT size=+2>D. &nbsp;<U>Printing Variables Using the System.out Object</U></FONT></P>
  <P>
  1. The <B>System.out</B> object is defined in each Java program. It has methods for displaying text 
  strings and numbers in plain text format on the system display (console). For example:
  </P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;<U>Program 3-2</U></FONT></P>
  <PRE>
  public class PrintVar  {
     public static void main(String[] args)  {
         int  number = 5;
         char  letter = 'E';
         double average = 3.95;
         boolean done = false;

         System.out.println("number = " + number);
         System.out.println("letter = " + letter);
         System.out.println("average = " + average);
         System.out.println("done = " + done);
         System.out.print("The ");
         System.out.println("End!");
     }
  }

  Run output:

  number = 5
  letter = E
  average = 3.95
  done = false
  The End!
  </PRE>
  <P>2. Method <B>System.out.println</B> displays (or prints) a line of text in the console window. 
  When <B>System.out.println</B> completes its task, it automatically positions the output cursor 
  (the location where the next character will be displayed) to the beginning of the next line in 
  the console window (this is similar to pressing the <I>Enter</I> key when typing in a text 
  editor—the cursor is repositioned at the beginning of the next line in your file).
  </P>
  <P>3. The expression
  </P>
  <PRE>
      "number = " + number
  </PRE>
  <P>from the statement
  </P>
  <PRE>
      System.out.println("number = " + number);
  </PRE>
  <P>uses the <strong>+</strong> as an operator to “link” or concatenate two strings. The result of 
  this operation is a new, and normally longer string. String concatenation is discussed in 
  more detail in the next lesson.  </P>
  <P>4. The lines
  </P>
  <PRE>
      System.out.print("The ");
      System.out.println("End!");
  </PRE>
  <P>of Program 3-2 display one line in the console window. The first statement uses 
    <strong>System.out</strong>’s method <strong>print</strong> to display a string. Unlike println, <strong>print</strong> displays the argument and positions the cursor after the last displayed character in the console window.</P>
  <P>5. Note the distinction between sending a text constant, "number = ", versus a variable, 
  number, to the System.out object.  Each variable will be printed out as represented by its declared data type, integer variables printed out like integers, boolean as true/false, and so forth.  </P>
  <P><FONT size=+2>E. &nbsp;<U>ASCII Code Values and Character Data</U></FONT></P>
  <P>1. As mentioned earlier in section B.5, a character value can easily be converted to 
  its corresponding ASCII integer value.
  </P>
  <P>2. A character value is stored using two bytes of memory, which consists of 16 bits 
  of binary (0 or 1) values.
  </P>
  <P>3. The letter 'A' has the ASCII value of 65, which is stored as the binary value 
  0000000001000001.  This is illustrated in the following program fragment:
  </P>
  <PRE>
    char letter = 'A';
    System.out.println("letter = " + letter);

    System.out.print("its ASCII position = ");
    System.out.print((int)letter);

    Run output:

    letter = A
    its ASCII position = 65
  </PRE>
  <P>The statement <strong>(int)letter</strong> is called a type conversion.  The data type of the variable 
  is converted to the prefix parenthesized type (int), if possible.  </P>
  <P>4. In Java, you can make a direct assignment of a character value to an integer variable, 
  and vice versa.  This is possible because both an integer and a character variable are 
  ultimately stored in binary.  However, it is better to be more explicit about such conversions 
  by using type conversions.  For example, the two lines of code below assign position the 
  ASCII value of letter.
  </P>
  <PRE>
    char letter = 'C';  // ASCII value = 67
    int position;

    position = letter;  // This is legal, position now equals 67
  </PRE>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.
  </P>
  <PRE>
    position = (int)letter;  // This is easier to understand.
  </PRE>
  <P><FONT size=+2>F. &nbsp;<U>Assignment Statements and Math Operators</U></FONT></P>
  <P>1. An assignment statement has the following basic syntax:<BR><BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  &lt;variable&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;expression&gt;;
  </P>
  <P>
  a. &nbsp;The <expression> can be a literal constant value such as 2, 12.25, 't'.<BR>
  b. &nbsp;The <expression> can also be a numeric expression involving operands (values)
  and operators.<BR>
  c. &nbsp;The  =  operator returns the value of the expression.  This means that 
  the statement
  </P>
  <PRE>
    a = 5;
  </PRE>
  <P>also results in the value 5.  This allows for chaining of assignment operators.
  </P>
  <PRE>
    a = b = 5;
  </PRE>
  <P>The assignment operator (=) is right-associative.  This means that the above 
  statement is really solved in this order:
  </P>
  <PRE>
    a = (b = 5);// solved from right to left.
  </PRE>
  <P>Since (b = 5) returns the integer 5, the value 5 is also assigned to variable a.
  </P>
  <P>2. Java provides 5 math operators as listed below:<BR><BR>
  + &nbsp;Addition, as well as unary +<BR>
  - &nbsp;Subtraction, as well as unary -<BR>
  * &nbsp;Multiplication<BR>
  / &nbsp;Real and integer division<BR>
  % &nbsp;Modulus, remainder of division	
  </P>
  <P>3. The numerical result and data type of the answer depends on the type of 
  operands used in a problem.
  </P>
  <P>4. For all the operators, if both operands are integers, the result is an integer.  
  Examples:
  </P>
  <PRE>
    2 + 3 = 5  (integer)	9 - 3 = 6  (integer)
    4 * 8 = 32 (integer)	11/2 = 5  (integer)
  </PRE>
  <P>5. If either of the operands is a float type, the result is a float type.  
  Examples:
  </P>
  <PRE>
    2 + 3.000 = 5.000  (float)
    25 / 6.75 = 3.7037 (float)
  </PRE>
  <P>
  a. &nbsp;When an integer and a float are used in a binary math expression, the 
  integer is promoted to a float value, then the math is executed.<BR>
  b. &nbsp;In the example 2 + 3.000 = 5.000, the integer value 2 is promoted to a 
  float (2.000) and then added to the 3.000.
  </P>
  <P>6. The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of dividing the first operand 
  by the second.  For example:
  </P>
  <PRE>
      10 % 3 = 1    2 % 4 = 2   16 % 2 = 0   27.475 % 7.22 = 5.815
  </PRE>
  <P>7. Changing the sign of a value can be accomplished with the negation operator 
  (-), often called the unary (-) operator.  A unary operator works with only one 
  value.  Applying the negation operator to an integer returns an integer, while 
  applying it to a float returns a float value.  For example:
  </P>
  <PRE>
      -(67) = -67      -(-2.345) = 2.345 
  </PRE>
  <P>8. To obtain the fractional answer to a question like 11/2 = 5.5, a type 
  conversion must be applied to one of the operands.
  </P>
  <PRE>
      (double)11/2	results in 5.5
	11.000/2	then we solve division
	5.5
  </PRE>
  <P>The type conversion operators are unary operators with the following syntax:
  </P>
  <PRE>
      (type) operand
  </PRE>
  <P>9. There is more to cover regarding operators in Java.  Topics such as math 
  precedence and assignment operators will be covered later.
