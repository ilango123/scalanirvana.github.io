        <p><font size=+2><u>A. Order of Algorithms</u></font></p>
        <p>1. The order of an algorithm is based on the number of steps that it 
          takes to complete a task. Time is not a valid measuring stick because 
          computers have different processing speeds. We want a method of comparing 
          algorithms that is independent of computing environment and microprocessor 
          speeds.</p>
        <p>2. Most algorithms solve problems involving an amount of data, N. The 
          order of algorithms will be expressed as a function of N, the size of 
          the data set.</p>
        <p> <br>
          3. The following chart summarizes the numerical relationships of common 
          functions of N.<br>
        </p>
        <p><img src="fig1.jpg" width="442" height="555"><br>
          a. The first column, N, is the number of items in a data set.<br>
          b. The other four columns are mathematical functions based on the size 
          of N. In computer science, we write this with a capital O (order) instead 
          of the traditional F (function) of mathematics. This type of notation 
          is the order of an algorithm, or Big O notation.<br>
          c. You have already seen the last column in an empirical sense when 
          you counted the number of steps in the quadratic sorting algorithms. 
          The relationship between columns A and E is quadratic - as the value 
          of N increases, the other column increases as a function of N2.<br>
          <br>
          d. As we work through the rest of the student outline, assume the following 
          array declaration of list applies:</p>
        <p><code><b>int</b>[] list = <b>new</b> <b>int</b>[4001];</code></p>
        <p>Here are the specifications of array <code>list</code>:</p>
        <p>1. Index position 0 keeps track of how many integers are stored as 
          data.<br>
          2. Integers are stored from positions <code>list[1] ... list[list[0]]</code>.</p>
        <p><font size=+2><u>B. Constant Algorithms, O(1)</u></font></p>
        <p>1. This relationship was not included in the chart. Here, the size 
          of the data set does not affect the number of steps this type of algorithm 
          takes. For example:\</p>
        <pre><b>int</b> howBig (<b>int</b>[] list)
{
    <b>return</b> list[0];
}</pre>
        <p>2. The number of data in the array could vary from 0..4000, but this 
          does not affect the algorithm of howBig. It will take one step regardless 
          of how big the data set is.</p>
        <p>3. A constant time algorithm could have more than just one step, as 
          long as the number of steps is independent of the size (N) of the data 
          set.<br>
        </p>
        <p><font size=+2><u>C. Log2N Algorithms, O(log2N)</u></font></p>
        <p>1. A logarithm is the exponent to which a base number must be raised 
          to equal a given number.</p>
        <p>2. A log2N algorithm is one where the number of steps increases as 
          a function of log2N. If the number of data was 1024, the number of steps 
          equals log2 1024, or 10 steps.</p>
        <p>3. Algorithms in this category involve splitting the data set in half 
          repeatedly. Several examples will be encountered later in the course. 
        </p>
        <p>4. Algorithms which fit in this category are classed as O(log N), regardless 
          of the numerical base used in the analysis.<br>
        </p>
        <p><font size=+2><u>D. Linear Algorithms, O(N)</u></font></p>
        <p>1. This is an algorithm where the number of steps is directly proportional 
          to the size of the data set. As N increases, the number of steps also 
          increases.</p>
        <pre><b>long</b> sumData (<b>int</b>[] list)
//  sums all the values in the array
{
  <b>long</b> total = 0;

  <b>for</b> (<b>int</b> loop = 1; loop <= list[0]; loop++)
  {
    total += list[loop];
  }
  <b>return</b> total;
}
</pre>
        <p>2. In the above example, as the size of the array increases, so does 
          the number of steps in the function.</p>
        <p>3. A non-recursive linear algorithm, O(N), always has a loop involved.</p>
        <p>4. Recursive algorithms are usually linear where the looping concept 
          is developed through recursive calls. The recursive factorial function 
          is a linear function.</p>
        <pre><b>long</b> fact (<b>int</b>  n)<br>//  precondition:  n &gt; 0<br>{<br>  <b>if</b> (1 == n)<br>    <b>return</b> 1;<br>  <b>else</b><br>    <b>return</b>  n * fact(n - 1);<br>}</pre>
        <p>The number of calls of fact will be n. Inside of the function is one 
          basic step, an if/then/else. So we are executing one statement n times.</p>
        <p><font size=+2><u>E. N * Log2N Algorithms, O(N * log2N)</u></font></p>
        <p>1. Algorithms of this type have a log N concept that must be applied 
          N times. </p>
        <p>2. When recursive MergeSort and Quicksort are covered, we will discover 
          that they are O(N * log2N) algorithms.</p>
        <p>3. These algorithms are markedly more efficient than our next category, 
          quadratics.<br>
        </p>
        <p><font size=+2><u>F. Quadratic Algorithms, (N^2)</u></font> </p>
        <p>1. This is an algorithm where the number of steps required to solve 
          a problem increases as a function of N2. For example, here is bubbleSort.</p>
        <pre><b>void</b> bubbleSort (<b>int</b>[][] list)
{
  <b>for</b> (<b>int</b> outer = 1; outer <= list[0]-1; outer++)
  {
    <b>for</b> (<b>int</b> inner = 1; inner <= list[0]-outer; inner++)
    {
      <b>if</b> (list[inner] > list[inner + 1])
      {
        // swap list[inner] & list[inner + 1]
        <b>int</b> temp = list[inner];
        list[inner] = list[inner + 1]);
        list[inner + 1] = temp;
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>
        <p>2. The <b>if</b> statement is buried inside nested loops, each of which 
          is tied to the size of the data set, N. The <b>if</b> statement is going 
          to happen approximately N2 times.</p>
        <p>3. The efficiency of this bubble sort was slightly improved by having 
          the inner loop decrease. But we still categorize this as a quadratic 
          algorithm.</p>
        <p>4. For example, the number of times the inner loop happens varies from 
          1 to (N-1). On average, the inner loop occurs (N/2) times.</p>
        <p>5. The outer loop happens (N-1) times, or rounded off N times.</p>
        <p>6. The number of times the if statement is executed is equal to this 
          expression:</p>
        <p># if statements = (Outer loop) * (Inner loop)<br>
          # if statements = (N) * (N/2)<br>
          # if statements = (N^2)/2<br>
          <br>
          7. Ignoring the coefficient of 1/2, we have an algorithm that is quadratic 
          in nature.</p>
        <p>8. When determining the order of an algorithm, we are only concerned 
          with its category, not a detailed analysis of the number of steps.<br>
        </p>
        <p><font size=+2><u>G. Other Orders</u></font></p>
        <p>1. A cubic algorithm is one where the number of steps increases as 
          a cube of N, or N^3.</p>
        <p>2. An exponential algorithm is one where the number of steps increases 
          as the power of a base, like 2^N.</p>
        <p>3. Both of these categories are astronomical in the number of steps 
          required. Such algorithms cannot be implemented on small personal computers.</p>
        <p><font size=+2><u>H. Comparison of Orders of Algorithms</u></font></p>
        <p>1. We obviously want to use the most efficient algorithm in our programs. 
          Whenever possible, choose an algorithm that requires the fewest number 
          of steps to process data.</p>
        <p>2. The transparency, T.A.22.1, <i>Order vs. Efficiency in Algorithms</i>, 
          summarizes all the categories in this lesson. Note that both axes in 
          this diagram are exponential in scale.</p>
