  <P ALIGN="left">The JAVA language provides some unusual operators called 
  assignment operators.  These shortcuts allow you to write shorter source 
  code and they allow the compiler to create more efficient runtime code.  
  Because of the abundance of operators in this language, the operator 
  precedence table in JAVA is a long one.  We begin our study of operator 
  precedence with the familiar math operators.<BR><BR>
  In keeping with the concept of recycling code, we will examine some of 
  the functions available in the <B>Math</B> class.  A fundamental set of 
  math methods are pre-defined in JAVA and ready for use.<BR><BR>
  The key topics for this lesson are:<BR><BR>
  A. &nbsp;Standard Math Methods<BR>
  B. &nbsp;Precedence of Math Operators<BR>
  C. &nbsp;Assignment Operators<BR>
  D. &nbsp;Increment Operators<BR>
  E. &nbsp;Named Constants

  <P><FONT size=+2>A. <U>Standard Math Methods</U></FONT></P>
  <P>1. The <B>Math</B> class in the <B>java.lang</B> package contains class methods for 
  commonly used mathematical functions.  Java loads the <B>java.lang</B> package automatically, 
  so no special actions are required to access these.
  </P>
  <P>2. For example, to express the mathematical formula
  <PRE>
      0.5 sin ( x - pi / y^3 )</PRE>
  Using the Math class constant and methods would give
  <PRE>
      (1.0/2.0) * Math.sin(x – Math.PI / Math.pow(y, 3) );  </PRE>
  Notice how the class methods and class constants are referred to in the expression. 
  The syntax is
  <PRE>
	&lt;class name&gt;.&lt;method name&gt; ( &lt;arguments&gt; );  </PRE>
  or
  <PRE>
	&lt;class name&gt;.&lt;class constant&gt;;  
  </PRE>
  </P>

  <P><FONT size=+2>B. &nbsp;<U>Precedence of Math Operators</U></FONT></P>
  <P>1. Precedence rules govern the order in which an expression is solved.  
  For example:
  <PRE>
	2 + 3 * 6 = 20       The * operator has priority over +.  </PRE>
  </P>
  <P>2. Associativity refers to the order in which operators are applied if they 
  have the same precedence level.  The two possibilities are from left-to-right or right-to-left.
  </P>
  <P>3.	The following table summarizes precedence and associativity of math operators:<BR><BR>
  <TABLE WIDTH = 400 BORDER = 1><TBODY>
  <TR><TH Width = "40%" ALIGN = middle>Level of Precedence</TH>
  <TH Width = "30%" ALIGN = middle>Operator</TH>
  <TH Width = "30%" ALIGN = middle>Associativity</TH></TR>

  <TD Width = "30%" ALIGN = middle>left to right</TD></TR>
  </TBODY></TABLE>
  </P>
  <P>4. An  example follows:<BR><BR>
  <TABLE WIDTH = 400 BORDER = 1><TBODY>
  <TR><TD Width = "60%" ALIGN = middle>9  +  5  *  7  %  8  -  5</TD>
  <TD Width = "40%" ALIGN = middle>(solve * first)</TD></TR>
  <TR><TD Width = "60%" ALIGN = middle>9  +  35  %  8  -  5</TD>
  <TD Width = "40%" ALIGN = middle>(solve % next)</TD></TR>
  <TR><TD Width = "60%" ALIGN = middle>9  +  3  -  5</TD>
  <TD Width = "40%" ALIGN = middle>(solve left-to-right)</TD></TR>
  <TR><TD Width = "60%" ALIGN = middle>7</TD>
  <TD Width = "40%" ALIGN = middle>&nbsp;</TD></TR>	
  </TBODY></TABLE>
  </P>
  <P>5. Parentheses take priority over all the math operators.
  <PRE>
      (5+6)/(9-7) = 11/2 = 5   (integer division is used here)  </PRE>
  </P>
  <P>6. JAVA has a long list of operators for which there are many  different levels of 
  precedence.  A partial list of the operators in JAVA have been summarized in <a href="../L06if-else/L06if-else.html#precedence">Chapter 6</a>, organized by precedence level.  </P>

  <P><FONT size=+2>C. &nbsp;<U>Assignment Operators</U></FONT></P>
  <P>1. The statement &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>number = number + 5;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp; is an example of an accumulation statement.  The old value of <B>number</B> 
  is incremented by 5 and the new value is stored in <B>number</B>.
  </P>
  <P>2. The above statement can be replaced as follows:
  <PRE>
	number += 5;  </PRE>
  </P>
  <P>3.	Java provides for the following assignment operators:
  <PRE>
        +=       -=       *=       /=       %=  </PRE>
  </P>
  <P>4. The following examples are equivalent statements:
  <PRE>
        rate *= 1.05;        rate = rate * 1.05;
        sum += 25;           sum = sum + 25;
        number %= 5;         number = number % 5;  </PRE>
  </P>
  <P>5. The precedence of the assignment operators is the lowest of all operators.
  </P>

  <P><FONT size=+2>D. &nbsp;<U>Increment Operators</U></FONT></P>
  <P>1. Incrementing or decrementing by one is a common task in programs.  This can 
  be solved by the statements:
  <PRE>
        n = n + 1;     or     n += 1;  </PRE>
  </P>
  <P>2. Java also provides a unary operator called an increment operator, ++.
  </P>
  <P>3. The statement  n = n + 1  can be rewritten as ++n. The following statements 
  are equivalent:
  <PRE>
        n = n + 1;          ++n;
        sum = sum + 1;      ++sum;  </PRE>	
  </P>
  <P>4. JAVA also provides for a decrement operator, --, which decrements a value by one.  
  The following are equivalent statements:
  <PRE>
        n = n - 1;          --n;
        sum = sum - 1;      --sum;  </PRE>
  </P>
  <P>5. The increment and decrement operator can be written as either a prefix or postfix 
  unary operator.  If the ++ is placed before the variable it is called a prefix increment 
  operator (++number), but it can follow after the variable (number++), which is called a 
  postfix increment operator.  The following three statements have the same effect:
  <PRE>
        ++number;      number++;      number = number + 1;  </PRE>
  </P>
  <P>6. Before we look at the difference between prefix and postfix unary operators it 
  is important to remember Java operators solve problems and often return values.  Just 
  as the assignment operator (=) returns a value, the ++ and -- operators return values.  
  Consider the following code fragments:<BR><BR>
  <TABLE WIDTH = 500 cellPadding = 10 BORDER = 1><TBODY>
  <TR><TD Width = "50%" ALIGN = left>int  a=1, b;<BR><BR>b = ++a;<BR><BR>
  After execution of the code<BR><BR>b = ++a;<BR><BR>a = 2 and b = 2</TD>
  <TD Width = "50%" ALIGN = left>int  a=1, b;<BR><BR>b = a++;<BR><BR>
  After execution of the code<BR><BR>b = a++;<BR><BR>a = 2 and b = 1</TD></TR>
  </TBODY></TABLE>
  </P>
  <P>7. The statement  b = ++a  uses the preincrement operator.  It increments the 
  value of a and returns the new value of a.
  </P>
  <P>8. The statement b = a++ uses the postincrement operator.  It increments the 
  value of a and returns the old value of a.
  </P>
  <P>9. The precedence and associativity of the unary increment and decrement operators 
  is the same as the unary - operator.
  </P>

  <P><FONT size=+2>E. &nbsp;<U>Named Constants</U></FONT></P>
  <P>1. Java allows for declaration of named constants in a program.  The general 
  syntax is:
  <PRE>
        final &lt;data type&gt; &lt;CONSTANT_NAME&gt; = &lt;expression&gt;;  </PRE>
  a. &nbsp;<B>final</B> is a Java reserved word<BR>
  b. &nbsp;&lt;data type&gt; is any previously defined type<BR>
  c. &nbsp;&lt;CONSTANT_NAME&gt; is a valid Java identifier<BR>
  d. &nbsp;&lt;expression&gt; is any valid expression of the appropriate type
  </P>
  <P>2. Examples:
  <PRE>
        final double PI = 3.14159;
        final double GAS_CONSTANT = 8.206E-2D;
        final short DAY_IN_WEEK = 7;
        final char BIG_J = 'J';  </PRE>
  </P>
  <P>3. Some programmers declare constant identifiers using all uppercase letters.  This 
  distinguishes such identifiers from variables.  This curriculum guide will use uppercase 
  identifiers for constant values.
  </P>
  <P>4.	The major benefit of using constant values occurs when such constants need to be 
  modified.  Suppose you have a program which uses a tax rate value in 20 different lines of 
  code.  If you had used the literal value of 0.0525, you would need to change the value in 20 
  different spots.  However, if you had declared a constant identifier and used the identifier 
  in those 20 spots, then one change at the top of the program would update the value throughout 
  the program.
  <PRE>
        final double TAXRATE = 0.0825;  </PRE>
  All references to TAXRATE are now changed.
