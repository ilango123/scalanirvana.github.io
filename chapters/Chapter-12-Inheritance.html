        <p align="left">Inheritance is a major component of a powerful and popular 
          programming technique known as object-oriented-programming. Inheritance 
          is a technique that will allow you to define a very general class and 
          then later define more specialized classes by simply adding some new 
          details to the older more general class definitions. This save work 
          because the more specialized class inherits all the properties of the 
          general class and you, the programmer, need only program the new features.</p>

        <p><font size=+2><u>A. Single Inheritance</u></font></p>
        <p>1.Inheritance enables you to define a new class based on a class that 
          already exists. The new class will be similar to the existing class, 
          but will have some new characteristics. This makes programming easier, 
          because you can build upon your previous work instead of starting out 
          from scratch.</p>
        <p>2. The class that is used as a basis for defining a new class is called 
          a superclass (or<i> parent class</i> or <i>base class</i>). The new 
          class based on the superclass is called a subclass (or <i>child class</i> 
          or <i>derived class</i>.) </p>
        <p>3. In Java, (unlike with humans) children inherit characteristics from 
          just one parent. This is called single inheritance. Some languages allow 
          a child to inherit from more than one parent. This is called multiple 
          inheritance. With multiple inheritance, it is sometimes hard to tell 
          which parent will contribute what characteristics to the child (as with 
          humans.) Java avoids these problems by using single inheritance. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p><br>
          4. The figure shows a superclass and a subclass. The line between them 
          shows the &quot;is a kind of&quot; relationship. Notice that the arrow 
          points to the superclass. The picture can be read as &quot;a Movie is 
          a kind of Video.&quot; The clouds represent classes. That is, the picture 
          does not show any particular Car or any particular Ford, but shows that 
          the class Ford is a subclass of the Car class. </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="fig1.jpg" width="312" height="247"><br>
        </p>
        <p>5. Inheritance is between classes, not between objects. A superclass 
          is a blueprint that is followed when an object is constructed. A subclass 
          of the superclass is another blueprint (that looks much like the original), 
          but with added features. The subclass is used to construct objects that 
          look like the superclass ' objects, but with added features. </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="fig2.jpg" width="344" height="316"></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>6. The figure shows a superclass and a subclass, and some objects that 
          have been constructed from each. These objects are shown as rectangles 
          (to convey the idea that they are more real than the classes, which 
          are only designs.) In the picture, &quot;Dilbert's Movie,&quot; &quot;Ada's 
          Star Wars,&quot; and &quot;Owen's Star Wars&quot; represent actual objects. 
          The cloudy classes represent designs that were used to construct the 
          objects. <br>
        </p>
        <p><font size=+2><u>B. Hierarchies</u></font></p>
        <p>1. 1. In a hierarchy, each class has at most one superclass, but might 
          have several subclasses. There is one class, at the &quot;top&quot; 
          of the hierarchy that has no superclass. This is sometimes called the 
          root of the hierarchy. </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="fig3.jpg" width="356" height="277"></p>
        <p>The figure shows a hierarchy of classes. It shows that &quot;<code>MusicVideo</code> 
          is a kind of <code>Video</code>,&quot; &quot;<code>Movie</code> is a 
          kind of <code>Video</code>,&quot; and that &quot;<code>HomeMovie</code> 
          is a kind of <code>Video</code>.&quot; It also shows that &quot;<code>StarWars</code> 
          is a kind of <code>Movie</code>.&quot; </p>
        <p>2. A <i>derived</i> class is a class defined by adding instance variables 
          and methods to an existing class. The existing class that the derived 
          class is built upon is called the <i>base class</i>. In our example, 
          the class Video is the base class and the classes <code>MusicVideo, 
          Movie, HomeMovie, and StarWars</code> are derived classes. </p>
        <p>3. The terms &quot;superclass&quot; and &quot;subclass&quot; are not 
          absolute. Any class may be the superclass for a subclass derived from 
          it. Just as with human relationships, an individual is a child to some 
          relatives and a parent to others. </p>
        <p>4. In Java, the syntax for deriving a child class from a parent class 
          is:<br>
        <pre><b>class </b>subclass <b>extends</b> superclass
{
   // new characteristics of the subclass go here
} 
</pre>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>5. Several classes can be declared as subclasses of the same superclass. 
          The subclasses, which might be referred to as &quot;sibling classes,&quot; 
          share some structures and behaviors - namely, the ones they inherit 
          from their common superclass. The superclass expresses these shared 
          structures and behaviors. In the diagram above, classes <code>MusicVideo, 
          Movie,</code> and <code>HomeMovie</code> are sibling classes. Inheritance 
          can also extend over several &quot;generations&quot; of classes. This 
          is shown in the diagram, where class <code>StarWars</code> is a subclass 
          of class <code>Movie </code>which is itself a subclass of class Video. 
          In this case, class <code>StarWars</code> is considered to be a subclass 
          of class <code>Video</code>, even though it is not a direct subclass.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><font size=+2><u>C. Using Inheritance</u></font></p>
        <p>1. Here is a program that uses a class <code>Video</code> to represent 
          movies available at a video rental store. The <code>Video</code> class 
          has basic information in it, and would be OK for documentaries and instructional 
          tapes. But movies need more information. An additional class, <code>Movie</code>, 
          is created that is similar to <code>Video</code>, but has the name of 
          the director and a rating. </p>
        <pre><b>class</b> Video
{
  <b>protected</b> String  myTitle;     // name of the item
  <b>protected int</b>     myLength;    // number of minutes
  <b>protected boolean</b> myIsAvail;   // is the tape in the store?

  <b>public</b> Video(String title, <b>int</b> len)
  {
    myTitle = title; myLength = len ; myIsAvail = true; 
  }

  <b>public</b> String toString()
  {
    <b>return</b> myTitle + ", " + myLength +
           " min. available: " + myIsAvail;
  }
}

<b>class</b> Movie <b>extends</b> Video
{
  <b>protected</b> String  myDirector;     // name of the director
  <b>protected</b> String  myRating;       // G, PG, R, or X

  // constructor
  <b>public </b>Movie(String title, <b>int</b> len, String dir, String rating)
  {
    // use the super class' constructor
    <b>super</b>(title, len);

    // initialize what's new to Movie
    myDirector = dir;  myRating = rating;
  }
}

<b>class</b> VideoStore
{

  <b>public static void </b>main (String args[])
  {
    Video item1 = <b>new</b> Video("Juiced on Java", 90 );
    Movie item2 = <b>new </b>Movie("Just Java", 120, "Gosling", "PG" );
    System.out.println(item1.toString());
    System.out.println(item2.toString());
  }
}
</pre>
        <p>2. The class Movie is a derived class (subclass) of Video. An object 
          of type Movie has the following members in it: </p>
        <table width="75%" border="1">
          <tr>
            <td>
              <div align="center"><b>Members</b></div>
            </td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td height="18"><code>MyTitle</code></td>
            <td height="18">inherited from <code>Video</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>myLength</code></td>
            <td>inherited from <code>Video</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>myIsAvail</code></td>
            <td>inherited from <code>Video</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>toString()</code></td>
            <td>inherited from <code>Video</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>myDirector</code></td>
            <td>defined in <code>Movie</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>myRating</code></td>
            <td>defined in <code>Movie</code></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Both classes are defined: the Video class can be used to construct 
          objects of that type, and now the Movie class can be used to construct 
          objects of the Movie type. </p>
        <p>3. The class definition for Video has a constructor that initializes 
          the member data of Video objects. The class Movie has a constructor 
          that initializes the data of Movie objects. The constructor for class 
          Movie looks like this: <br>
        <pre>// constructor
<b>public</b> Movie(String title, <b>int</b> len, String dir, String rating)
{
  // use the super class' constructor
  <b>super</b>(title, len);

  // initialize what's new to Movie
  myDirector = dir;  myRating = rating;
}
</pre>
        <p>The statement super(title, len) invokes the base class' constructor 
          to initialize some of the data. Then the next two statements (on one 
          line) initialize the members that only Movie has. When super is used 
          in this way, it must be the first statement in the subclass' constructor. 
        </p>
        <p>4. It is not necessary to use super; the following would also work 
          as a constructor for Movie: <br>
        </p>
        <pre>// constructor
<b>public</b> Movie(String title, <b>int</b> len, String dir, String rating)
{
  // initialize the inherited members
  myTitle = title; myLength = len ; myIsAvail = true;

  // initialize members unique to Movie
  myDirector = dir;  myRating = rating;
}</pre>
        <p>In this constructor, each variable of the newly created Movie object 
          is set to an initial value. </p>
        <p>5. So far, we have only seen the <b>public</b> and <b>private</b> access 
          modifiers. There is a third access modifier that can be applied to an 
          instance variable or method. If it is declared to be <b>protected</b>, 
          then it can be used in the class where it is defined and in any subclass 
          of that class. This is obviously less restrictive than <b>private</b> 
          and more restrictive than <b>public</b>. Classes that are written specifically 
          to be used as a basis for making subclasses often have protected members. 
          The protected members are there to provide a foundation for the subclasses 
          to build on. But they are still invisible to the public at large.<br>
        </p>
        <p><font size=+2><u>D. Method Overriding</u></font></p>
        <p>1. A derived class can <i>override</i> a method from its base class 
          by defining a replacement method with the same signature. For example 
          in our <code>Movie</code> subclass, the <code>toString()</code> method 
          contained in the Video superclass can not reference the new variables 
          that have been added to objects of type <code>Movie</code>, so nothing 
          new is printed out. We need a new <code>toString()</code> method in 
          the class Movie:<br>
        <pre><br>// overrides the toString method in the parent class
<b>public </b>String toString()
{
  <b>return</b> myTitle + ", " + myLength +
         " min. available: " + myIsAvail +
         ", dir: " + myDirector + ", " + myRating;  
}
</pre>
        <p>2. Even though the base class has a toString() method, the new definition 
          of toString() in the derived class will override the base class' version 
          . The base class has its method, and the derived has its own method 
          with the same name. With the change in the class Movie the following 
          program will print out the full information for both items. <br>
        <pre><br><b>class</b> VideoStore
{
  <b>public static void </b>main (String args[])
  {
    Video item1 = <b>new</b> Video("Samurai Jack", 90 );
    Movie  item2 = <b>new</b> Movie("Star Wars", 120, "Lucas", "PG");
    System.out.println(item1.toString());
    System.out.println(item2.toString());
  }
}

Samurai Jack, 90 min. available: true
Star Wars, 120 min. available: true, dir: Lucas, PG
</pre>
        <p>The line item1.toString() calls the toString() method defined in Video, 
          and the line item2.toString() calls the toString() method defined in 
          Movie.</p>
        <p>3.<code> </code>Sometimes (as in the example) you want a derived class 
          to have its own method, but that method includes everything the derived 
          class' method does. You can use the super reference in this situation 
          to first invoke the original toString() method in the base class as 
          follows:<br>
          <br>
        <pre><b>public</b> String toString()
{
  <b>return</b> <b>super</b>.toString()+ ", dir: " + myDirector + ", " + myRating;  
}
</pre>
        <p>Unlike the case when super is used in a constructor, inside a method 
          super does not have to be used in the first statement.</p>

        <p align="left">Inheritance represents the &quot;is a kind of&quot; relationship 
          between types of objects. In practice it may be used to a new features 
          to an existing class. It is the primary tool for reusing your own and 
          standard library classes. Inheritance allows a programmer to derive 
          a new class (called a derived class or a subclass) from another class 
          (called a base class or superclass). A derived class inherits all the 
          data fields and methods (but not constructors) from the base class and 
          can add its own methods or redefine some of the methods of the base 
          class.
